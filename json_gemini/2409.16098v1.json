One major issue is poor access to basic health care services, often resulting from a scarcity of health care facilities and trained health care professionals. \u00b9 Ineffective health information systems hamper the effective collection and utilization of data for decision-making and resource allocation. 2 Health disparities are aggravated by socioeconomic factors, resulting in the poorest populations having the least access to essential health care services and an increased disease burden. 3 Infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria disproportionately affect LMICs, straining their health systems and diverting scarce resources from other important public health initiatives. Furthermore, the rise of non-communicable diseases presents a dual burden, complicating efforts to enhance public health amidst already constrained circumstances. 5 Despite advancements in health care, High-Income Countries (HICs) also face significant challenges. Pervasive issues related to patient engagement, adherence to treatments, and adoption of public health interventions prevail. 6\nAccelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global health care sector is experiencing rapid growth in the use of digital health tools as promising solutions to persistent challenges encountered by patients, caregivers, and suppliers.\u2077 As part of the impetus towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the World Health Organization has recognized health worker decision support and targeted provider and patient communication via mobile applications as part of a set of prioritized digital interventions for health system strengthening. These platforms can support communication, management of patients and chronic conditions, self-reporting, adherence support, access to medical knowledge bases and pharmaceutical catalogs, capacity building and procurement of drugs and medical supplies, and inventory and distribution management.\nIn recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in health care, capable of utilizing data for decision-making and personalized interventions. 9\u201312 \u0391\u0399 systems can use adequately tracked data from digital health platforms to offer insights, predictions, and recommendations into patient and provider behaviors, health care quality, and demand, facilitating the development of adaptive interventions delivered through digital tools. 13-17 AI-enhanced adaptive interventions are not only tailored but also continuously evolve, adapting in real-time to each user's unique choices and circumstances, thereby determining the content and timing of interventions, and identifying individuals who may need additional support. Furthermore, AI can be used to anticipate medication demand variations to help in inventory management. Enabling prediction-based timely reminders and guidance systems can promote consistent availability of vital supplies across all distribution channels. 18\nAI can also be used to harmonically combine and reconcile information from multiple sources, including the variety of digital tools described in the previous paragraphs, which contain rich information on the health care system's status, functioning, and efficiency at different levels. By merging these and others into a holistic picture, evidence-based decision-making can be facilitated, giving rise to a framework that policymakers can use to systematically explore, understand, and quantify the real or potential impact of different (current or planned) public health strategies and health system policies. AI technologies can also be used in experimental designs for robust risk-minimizing public policy evaluation.\nDigital adaptive strategies are predominantly seen in HICs, particularly in entertainment and e-commerce. 19,20 However, the rising mobile health infrastructure in LMICs and surging smartphone adoption present a significant potential for positive global health impacts through adaptive measures, with an increasing number of digital and adaptive intervention initiatives appearing in and targeting the Global South in recent years. 21-25\nThis paper presents an AI platform designed to generate personalized predictions, recommendations, and insights by harnessing and analyzing data from digital health tools and other relevant sources. The platform provides the capability to create, test, and deploy adaptive interventions driven by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable optimized user engagement, resource allocation recommendations, and clinical and behavioral guidance for users. These capabilities are possible through the platform's integration with existing digital tools designed to support patients, medical facilities, pharmacists, Community Health Workers (CHWs), midwives, and distributors of drugs and medical consumables, enhancing their operational efficacy. This paper is intended for a public health audience. While references are provided for the interested technical reader, it deliberately avoids delving into the technicalities and specificities of the AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods utilized by the platform, prioritizing instead a focus on the practical benefits and outcomes relevant to the public health context.\nWhile the discussion is framed specifically around the impact on health systems in LMICs, the same approach would benefit health systems in HICs by driving efficiency and better health outcomes. While the use of AI for certain use cases is more widespread in these contexts, an integrated approach that would unleash the full potential of this framework is yet not in place for even the most resourceful health systems."}, {"title": "2 DIGITAL HEALTH AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE", "content": "Artificial Intelligence is becoming essential everywhere and is increasingly being used in public health and health care. AI has recently received significant attention due to the popularization of large language models (LLMs).\nAt their core, AI and ML are techniques that enable systems to learn patterns from large sets of data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. In most cases, these tools are designed to make predictions from large amounts of data without focusing on understanding the underlying mechanisms driving the system outputs. 26 Several domains within AI have been used for different problems, such as natural language processing, time series forecasting, and computer vision. However, AI is a rapidly evolving field with an active research community exploring new applications underpinned by the increasing computational power.\nGiven the large amounts of data generated by digitized health systems, harnessing AI to extract meaningful insights and make evidence-based decisions has become a frontier in public health and health care. 27-30 Potential applications specifically for global health have also gathered attention in recent years. 9,12\nPredictive analytics, an important ML component, allows public health professionals to forecast disease and potential outbreak trends. For instance, ML algorithms can be trained on historical epidemiological data to predict future disease hotspots or to identify factors that make populations susceptible to certain health challenges. This forward-looking capability can support optimal resource allocation and the timely deployment of public health measures to protect vulnerable populations more efficiently with targeted interventions. 31-33\nAnother transformative application lies in behavioral nudges and other personalized interventions. 34\u201337 By analyzing individuals' behaviors, habits, and preferences, ML algorithms can craft personalized messages or recommendations designed to encourage the adoption of best practices, healthier choices, and adherence to treatment and public health interventions, among other behaviors. 14,38 These systems dynamically adapt and allow rapid innovation cycles, supporting the deployment of agile and responsive public health and health care systems.\nFinally, in the face of digital health fragmentation, where systems often operate in silos with limited interoperability, AI systems are capable of integrating diverse data streams and then offering contextualized insights. CHW job aids, procurement and supply chain management apps, electronic health records, and customer-facing tools serving patients and caregivers all generate vast data. When exploited by AI, these data can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of health systems.\nThe following subsections expand on how AI can be leveraged to improve the health system's efficiency and outcomes."}, {"title": "2.1 Primary care facilities and frontline health care worker engagement and support", "content": "In LMICs, primary health care (PHC) facilities often lack the necessary human and material resources to operate adequately, despite strong community-based integrated PHC being recognised globally as one of the cornerstones for UHC, quality of care and improved health outcomes. 39 Frontline health care workers (FHCWs), especially in LMICs, grapple with challenges like fragmented programming, lack of continuous performance assessments, and the overwhelming task of managing diverse patient needs with limited resources. In addition, health systems struggle to ensure health care workers are well-trained, supervised, and equipped to provide quality care.\nDigital tools can support FHCWs and PHC facilities by offering guidance through clinical processes and connecting them to their patients and peers. They can also be used for capacity building, continuous professional development, operational tasks such as appointment management and referrals, and the provision of required tests and drugs and their stock management. The pervasive use of patient management and clinical decision support tools facilitates reporting and can promote adherence to established clinical guidelines and efficient resource allocation.\nSome examples of tools that are already being used by health workers (HWs) and facilities are CHARM (Client & Community Health Assisted Resources for Mentors, a job aid used by Mothers2mothers' mentor mothers in Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), 40 Lifebank's Nerve App (which allows hospitals and clinics in Nigeria to conveniently order blood, oxygen and medical consumables online), 41 Ilara Health's HMIS (Health Management Information System, a digital tool for streamlined clinic operations in Kenya, including guided consultations, electronic health records, patient billing and inventory management), 42 Global Strategies' NoviGuide (neonatal care clinical decision support software available worldwide), 43 and Maternity Foundation's Safe Delivery App (capacity building and job aid for skilled birth attendants, available worldwide with a generic version with additional language and context specific versions for multiple countries), 44-46 just to name a few.\nIntegrating AI and ML into digital tools in the hands of HWs offers promising avenues to improve their ability to provide quality health care. 22 Personalized interventions can support adaptive learning journeys, timely reminders for crucial tasks, incentives for best practices, and patient-specific recommendations based on clinical and behavioral data, optimizing the performance and impact of health care workers. For example, AI-powered digital tools can use patient data to assist FHCWs in identifying high-risk patients who could benefit from extra support planning visits and targeted communications. This is particularly important in the case of Community Health Workers (CHWs), who play a crucial role in linking formal health care systems with local and often remote communities and usually suffer from limited tools and skills.\nWhen it comes to improving the skills of HWs, the challenge often lies in ensuring adherence to digitally enabled training programs. ML tools allow for the building of adaptive learning journeys, in which user data is utilized to design individualized nudges and content so we ensure they are engaged in the program and can pass every certification at an adequate speed for everyone.\nFinally, AI systems can also support HWs by offering patient-specific recommendations regarding clinical workflows (e.g., on additional testing advised for diagnosis or before prescription or referral to a facility). While this paper is focused on operational and behavioral aspects of health care and public health, the AI functionalities presented in the following sections would be equally applicable for purely clinical interventions."}, {"title": "2.2 Patient and caregiver engagement and support", "content": "Patients and caregivers in LMICs face daunting challenges when seeking health care, including timely access to life-saving commodities and medical advice. Digital apps can support them by connecting them to relevant health information, health care providers, and pharmacies.\nThese digital tools generate vast amounts of data on patients' health, the information they seek, and other health-related behaviors. For example, AI has the potential to improve the impact of family planning programs significantly. With increasing mobile penetration in these countries, particularly among the youth, AI-driven apps can ensure, for example, that teenagers and young adults are provided with tailored advice on contraceptive choices, potential side effects, and proper usage. Through the integration with pharmacy chains, they can also access contraceptives online, decreasing the barrier to these products related to social norms.\nThat is the case of already deployed and widespread solutions, such as Momentum (used in Ghana to order drugs online from the Aide Chemist chain), 47 Vitala Global's Aya Contigo (virtual sexual and reproductive health companion available in Venezuela and the USA), 48 Chekkit App (an anti-counterfeiting solution for drugs and other products), 49 and Appy Saude (app- or web-based online ordering of drugs and other products available in the network of partner pharmacies in Angola). 50\nBy centering patient needs and offering AI-driven solutions to address challenges, the health care landscape in LMICs can be significantly transformed, ensuring that patients receive the robust support they require."}, {"title": "2.3 Pharmacies", "content": "On many occasions, pharmacies are the first line of contact for patients seeking treatment. Pharmacists ensure patients and caregivers get the proper medical advice, adhere to treatment, and responsibly use drugs to counter antibiotic resistance.\nIn many LMICs, one of the key challenges is ensuring pharmacies stay abreast of the guidelines and offer quality care to patients. Digital tools offer an opportunity to provide training and gather data on pharmacy patients. AI can leverage this data to ensure pharmacists receive the right nudges and incentives to follow guidelines and provide the right care, strengthening pharmacies' role in the overall health system.\nAnother dimension is the pharmacist as a business operator. Inventory management, forecasting, and procurement optimization are some of the critical functions pharmacists struggle with. This involves proactive collaboration with pharmaceutical warehouses to replenish stock while judiciously balancing the demand against the risk of overstocking, which can lead to wastage through expired medications. AI systems can support all these functions, ensuring pharmacies are well-stocked with life-saving commodities.\nA noteworthy trend in LMICs is the growth of tech companies specializing in B2B e-commerce distribution to avoid dependence on expensive intermediaries to acquire supplies. Simultaneously, many pharmacies are evolving into franchises and chains. E-commerce applications for health care products are becoming a convenient and often cheaper way to purchase goods, allowing tracking and visibility of the demand and drug stock movement. AI can leverage the data generated through these digital tools, providing consumers with tailored and timely recommendations for adequate consumption and helping pharmacists manage their stocks to ensure essential medicines are always available.\nNotable examples of such platforms are SwipeRx (a comprehensive tool for Southeast Asia pharmacies, including B2B e-commerce, professional networking, continuous professional development, and more) and Field's Shelf Life (a supply service for pharmacies in Kenya and Nigeria operating both on-demand and by subscription models). 51,52"}, {"title": "2.4 Supply Chains", "content": "Supply chains are a vital component of health systems. However, the intricacy of these networks, especially in LMICs, often results in stockouts across the supply chain and at the point of care. .53 The prevalence of substandard and falsified drugs is also an issue in some markets. Efficient supply chains prevent wastage and counterfeiting, safeguard against stockouts, and ensure that life-saving commodities, such as antimalarials and antibiotics, are available at the point of care. Field's Supply is an example of such a supply chain software. 52\nDigital tools have the potential to make the supply chain more efficient. They can ease procurement (through B2B solutions described in the previous section) and reduce paperwork, using different technologies such as computer vision or RFID to improve inventory management and prevent the circulation of substandard and falsified medicines. Software for supply chain processes facilitates the storage of reliable data with integrity, enabling its systematic use for knowledge extraction and intervention. That is the case of Chekkit, a blockchain-based solution for consumers to verify the authenticity of drugs and other products. 49\nAI can use real-time data from digital applications, including inventory levels, demand patterns, and other factors like climate events or disease outbreaks, to understand their past evolution and to predict future needs. This promotes timely stock replenishment and aids in detecting abnormal behaviors or potential supply disruptions early. These models empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, optimizing the supply chain from procurement to delivery. 54\nCustomers, distributors, and other key actors in the supply chain system can receive tailored support through reminders, product recommendations and prioritization, and order and distribution plan proposals. These interventions can leverage demand and user behavior predictions and make the adaptive framework work to optimize distribution operations and reduce stockouts of essential medications at points of care."}, {"title": "2.5 Policymakers and health authorities", "content": "The above sections have highlighted the effect digital tools have on the day-to-day work and efficiency of health care delivery's main figures and the potential of AI to magnify and scale their impact. This, in itself, is bound to have a noticeable upstream effect on the health system's performance as a whole. However, additional benefits of the use of these technologies are to be expected.\nAI can be used to organize and learn from the sources of information readily available for health authorities and other health systems decision-makers, such as public facility periodic reporting and performance-based financing. A combination of incentives and regulations can be used to promote the integration of additional sources of relevant information, including those described in the previous subsections. All these sources can be combined and transformed into relevant insights that can give health authorities and other stakeholders, such as health insurance or international cooperation agencies, a bird's eye view of the health system's functioning.\nEfficiency, performance, and outcome indicators can be defined and monitored at different levels (practitioner, facility, region. . .). A system of alerts can be built through outlier detection, which can direct decision-makers to issues needing intervention and provide examples of success to learn from. Data can be used to understand better the specific needs of the population served, the availability of material and human resources, and the challenges, strengths, and financial health of different facilities. This knowledge can then be used to allocate better all kinds of resources (human, drugs and medical equipment, funding, training, and capacity building...) and to design strategies to tackle specific issues (e.g., unequal stockout frequency of an essential drug, of need for referral, or of neonatal mortality between two different facilities or neighboring regions).\nA predictive layer on top of this integrated information system further enhances the framework's potential for planning, even allowing for the simulation of the effects of different policies and decisions under various scenarios. The predicted impact of any policy change can be further validated through experimentation, with adaptive designs allowing for safer rollouts."}, {"title": "3 A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PLATFORM FOR DIGITAL HEALTH", "content": "We propose an AI platform designed to support health systems in LMICs (e.g., health care facilities, frontline health care workers, pharmacies, patients, and supply chains). This platform is the product of our efforts to ensure the potential of AI can be easily integrated into the growing number of digital health tools to achieve the benefits described in the previous section. It is designed to integrate with existing software already in use, which reduces the time needed to see effective interventions deployed and scaled while providing a bridge connecting different specialized systems that often contribute to the fragmentation of health systems. The result is a platform that allows the use of ML to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the health system and improve patient outcomes.\nBeyond predictive modeling, a unique feature of the platform is that it allows testing and deploying adaptive interventions using digital tools. These interventions include sending messages (SMS, WhatsApp, push notification, in-app messages, etc.) to the users to promote behaviors such as adherence to treatment, reading or listening to relevant health information, or taking a training course. By adaptive, we mean that the system continuously tailors the intervention content and timing to each user based on the feedback collected from the ensemble of users."}, {"title": "3.1 The platform", "content": "The primary aim of our platform is to integrate vast data sets (maximizing their quality, proper format, and label) from digital tools, including behavioral, clinical, and contextual data, to provide valuable insights to stakeholders and create, test, and deploy personalized interventions such as nudges, recommendations, and in-app personalized content. The platform ensures that acquired data are well organized and ready for ML predictive models. This emphasis on data collection and the use of opinionated data schemas is at the core of the platform functionality.\nThe digital platform is built upon three foundational components: the (platform user-facing) frontend, which provides a comprehensive user interface with data and results visualization; the backend, which serves as the operational core (depicted as the pipelines, database, and algorithms within the gray box in the Figure); and the SDK, acting as the crucial bridge between the digital tools (end user in the Figure) and the platform. Each component is essential, ensuring users can seamlessly access, analyze, and manage their data and deploy ML models and real-time interventions. Below, we provide additional details for each of these three components.\nThe frontend has an intuitive user interface for data analysis and model and intervention management and monitoring. Users can perform behavioral and clinical data analysis, statistical modeling, and create cohorts of users. Furthermore, the interface enables designing, testing, and deploying interventions such as nudges and rewards. It guides the user from the subject cohort (FHCWs, facilities, pharmacists, etc.) to analyze past behavior, predict future or target interventions, and sample definition through algorithm selection to feature selection and target specification, including nudge alternatives in the case of interventions. The dashboard illustrates various traits, predictions, and metrics in an intuitive format for a clear interpretation of the results and impact of the interventions.\nThe backend is the platform's core, allowing the organization of data and the implementation of ML models and adaptive interventions. Data is collected and organized using domain-specific data schemas optimized for ML model implementation. Data security and privacy are key aspects captured in the backend. This standardized design of event logging enables the platform to be a uniform interface for transformation and aggregation across different application domains, e.g., supply chain and e-commerce marketplace, medication tracking, and patient communication. Finally, the backend hosts the predictive modeling engine that handles the ML component and the algorithmic decision-making service. These modules configure, train, host, and manage models for time series forecasting, deep and ensemble survival analysis, and sequential decisions via reinforcement learning."}, {"title": "3.2 Predictive Modeling", "content": "Predictive modeling is crucial in defining who should be targeted with specific interventions and optimizing their timing. The platform allows the user to fully utilize three important prediction models: time-to-event prediction (also known as survival analysis), demand forecasting, and recommendation systems, such as click-through-rate predictions or causal graphic analysis\u00b2.\nTime-to-event prediction offers a way of characterizing behaviors by modeling the probability of occurrence of different events of interest and the duration between them. 55\u201357,34 For example, we can use it to predict the risk of non-adherence to treatment and the time for it to happen, client churn rate in an e-commerce platform and a health worker failing to complete a training module. These predictions can identify the target subjects for specific interventions (e.g., reminders to support treatment adherence, promotions to discourage churn, motivational prompts, and incentives to encourage learning).\nDemand forecasting is crucial in e-commerce, supply chain, and inventory optimization. For example, multivariate forecasting methods that learn either point or probabilistic forecasts from co-dependent time series for predicting the demand for different pharmaceutical products at other sites. 58 Several approaches are available through the platform, including autoregression- and graph-regularized factor analysis and latent state forecasting, state space modeling with LSTM and Gaussian copula for probabilistic forecasts, recurrent networks for multivariate count data with non-uniform scale, and attention-based deep models for multi-horizon interval predictions. 59-63 The observed stocks and previous ordering behavior, together with the predicted evolution of demand, can be used to identify what pharmacies have to receive reminders to restock or suggest products to add to the cart while ordering. Similar approaches can be used for patients using e-commerce services and to support decisions on distributing stocks across warehouses.\nClick-through-rate predictions allow the generation of traits useful for content personalization. Mixed deep learning-based and factorization methods have shown good performance in the literature. 64\u201368 As described in the next section, adaptive delivery will be the main mechanism to learn and exploit user preferences for recommendations and personalization. Other recommendation algorithms are available as they can provide valuable insights to be leveraged by the reinforcement learning algorithm.\nOther models, such as causal graph analysis, help to understand cause-and-effect relationships. Which factors caused an event, e.g., why did a particular user stop using the app, or why a patient is more likely to stop a treatment. The known causes will help drive the design of personalized interventions to reduce the chance of that event in the future."}, {"title": "3.3 Adaptive Intervention Delivery and Experimentation", "content": "One of the platform's key features is the ability to design, test, and deploy adaptive interventions. Adaptive intervention delivery uses individual and contextual data for effective nudging and interventions.\nLet us illustrate the main underlying ideas using a concrete example: Imagine we have a digital tool (an app) for pregnant women and mothers through which they report information on their pregnancy and newborn (e.g., overall well-being, health issues they might have, vaccination, use of health care services) and receive relevant health information. The tool allows us to detect any health issue the women and their newborns might have and provide them with relevant health advice (such as recommendations on when to seek care from a health provider). Of course, the impact of this patient engagement tool hinges on women using the tool. However, we know user engagement is challenging to maintain. 69\nThrough some formative research, behavioral science analysis, and focus group discussions, we decide the interventions we want to test are: one that nudges women with some recommendations related to their characteristics (stage of pregnancy or age of their newborn) and another one that sends messages with suggestions based on behaviors similar users exhibited in the past.\nWe then determine how to measure the intervention's success. In this case, we use the information women submit through digital tools.\nThe last piece is to select the characteristics (collected through the digital tool) that could influence how impactful a particular nudge will be at any given time. These could include characteristics of women and their babies (e.g., gestational age, number of previous pregnancies) and their use of the digital tool (e.g., recent exposure and interaction with nudges, the information they have sent through the app, and which content they never used). We refer to these characteristics as contextual traits.\nThe adaptive intervention delivery then comes into action, deciding each week (or as scheduled when defining the intervention) which of the nudges to send to each user based on the values of these contextual traits, observing how users with different characteristics react (based on how we decided to measure success) in various situations (as defined by the contextual traits). The algorithm will continue to refine (and exploit) the information of what works best in which situation. It will also detect changes in how users react to the nudges and adapt them correspondingly.\nAt the end of the experiment, we will be able to select the intervention that was most successful in increasing engagement or discard them if they did not generate a significant change. Note that the selected intervention will continue to learn over time as it collects additional feedback.\nThis example illustrates how the platform's intervention and experimentation capabilities can be used to assess the impact of different intervention strategies.\nThe user can perform rapid cycles of experimentation for intervention refinement using a sample of users and subsequently roll out the final intervention to all the users. Digital trials can be easily designed and conducted through the platform, including near real-time monitoring with impact estimation and heterogeneous effects analysis. Both fully randomized and adaptive designs are available. One remark is that adaptive experiments do not need to stop. In randomized trials, such as A/B testing, the researcher pauses the experiment, measures which treatment is statistically significantly better than others, and decides accordingly. In adaptive studies (like the one described in the example above), it is possible to run them indefinitely, making them select the best-responding treatment. The algorithm automatically selects the most conditionally effective treatment and may also adapt to the non-stationarity of the treatment response.\nAdaptive designs maximize statistical power and minimize risk, as the algorithm will consider the experimental outcomes already observed and reduce the number of subjects assigned to treatment in the event of an adverse effect on the success measure. Experimental designs that assign each subject multiple times throughout the experiment can be better options when studying the immediate impact of repeated interventions (e.g., messages sent with a specific frequency), while trials with single assignment and a pure control group remain the golden standard to understand one-shot interventions and long-term effects. 70-77"}, {"title": "3.4 Bandit Algorithms", "content": "Adaptive interventions are typically modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which makes RL the appropriate algorithmic paradigm.80 RL-based interventions balance between outcome optimization and knowledge extraction and adapt to the feedback and observed covariates of the intervention subjects. Within RL, bandit algorithms are particularly well suited for the problems described in the previous section.\nBandit algorithms can be thought of as online optimization methods with built-in model identification from partial feedback: the algorithm makes adaptive sequential decisions based on the past observed covariates and interaction history to eliminate suboptimal choices. 81\nIn our setting, the algorithm analyzes the available features of each observed subject (the static and dynamic traits), decides on the allocation or type of intervention, and later receives a feedback score of its prior decision, which it uses to adapt and improve its decision mechanism. Possible applications of adaptive algorithms include sending actionable reminders about treatment adherence and scaling back on them when the notification has been sent too recently or is not being interacted with.\nThe analysis of bandit algorithms is beyond the scope of this paper, but there are plenty of resources exploring these algorithms, their use, challenges, and solutions. 81-107"}, {"title": "3.5 Current development status", "content": "The AI platform described in this paper is currently (as of June 2024) fully operational, integrated with close to ten digital tools, and growing.\nCausal Foundry's open source SDK includes modules to track data from patient management, capacity building, e-commerce, supply chain, and condition management (patient self-tracking) tools. The core module takes care of the activity common across all types of applications. The module- (and to a large extent use-case-) specific data pipelines create hundreds of indicators at the user, HW, facility, patient, drug, or medical supply level that can be visualized in the platform and used throughout it for cohort creation, as features for ML models and for intervention.\nFour classes of ML models can be easily defined, trained, deployed, and monitored through the platform: five time-to-event prediction algorithms, neural embedding-based item recommendation, ten contextual bandit algorithms for adaptive personalization and experimentation, and three restless bandit algorithms specifically well suited for optimal and equitable resource allocation. The platform's adaptive intervention capabilities have already been tested with multiple interventions, many of which have had a significant positive impact, and many others are already planned for the immediate and near future.\nThe platform also includes an Assistant that uses the generative models described in Section 4. It allows platform users to query all the information available through visualization throughout the platform conversationally.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are part of GAI and are trained on large datasets consisting of text. Once trained, the model can generate coherent, contextually relevant, and grammatically correct texts, answer questions, and perform text-based tasks. LLMs can revolutionize how health care workers interact with information systems, enabling more efficient access to medical data and supporting decision-making. Integrating LLMs in frontline health workers' mobile applications can leverage the benefits of a chat-based interface to facilitate user interaction and access to information more easily. Within the proposed framework, chatbots are integrated into the AI platform to employ LLM-based functionalities, as is depicted in Figure 5.\nThe product aims to empower CHWs, midwives, pharmacists, and clinicians by providing insights from their data related to their practices or patients. The LLMs are pre-trained with internal data and predictions based on mobile application usage, which are stored and organized by the AI platform. Frontline health workers can access the chatbot embedded in their digital tools to obtain answers to questions about the past or future to help their supply ordering and patient management. Some examples of questions would be: Which patients haven't I visited for over three months? Who have I referred to clinical practice in the past two months? How many HIV RDTs should I order for the next four weeks?\nLLMs can also be integrated into the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) framework to create a tool that will assist health care workers in their daily patient interactions. The tool records and summarizes provider-client interactions, converting audio to structured data, sending next-step reminders, streamlining data collection, and reducing manual data entry to enable more focused patient interactions. Workers can review session details, read audio transcripts, and add insights anytime. GAI-generated personalized care plans and medication recommendations can combine patient-specific data with evidence-based guidelines.\nMoreover, trained on specialized datasets, GAI and LLMs aid patients and pharmacists by providing comprehensive information about available drugs, their possible side effects, and interactions. In health-tracking and medication procurement apps, LLMs help patients make informed treatment decisions regarding non-prescription or over-the-counter medicines by offering insights into potential side effects and interactions, allowing them to explore detailed information about their prescribed drugs or find suitable alternatives."}, {"title": "5 ETHICAL AI", "content": "In the transformative realm of digital health care", "them": "transparency and systematic supervision.

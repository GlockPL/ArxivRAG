This survey outlines the current state of coordination research across applications through a unified understanding that answers four fundamental coordination questions: (1) what is coordination; (2) why coordination; (3) who to coordinate with; and (4) how to coordinate. Our purpose is to explore existing ideas and expertise in coordination and their connections across diverse applications, while identifying and highlighting emerging and promising research directions. First, general coordination problems that are essential to varied applications are identified and analyzed. Second, a number of MAS applications are surveyed, ranging from widely studied domains, e.g., search and rescue, warehouse automation and logistics, and transportation systems, to emerging fields including humanoid and anthropomorphic robots, satellite systems, and large language models (LLMs).

This spreading trend of MAS has especially accelerated in the last decade. New MAS applications and multi-agent tasks emerge with technological advancement and new requirements, which offer novel opportunities and challenges to better solve complex problems from the MAS perspective. Most recently, multiple large language model (LLM) based MAS methods have demonstrated the desirable ability of collective (a.k.a. swarm) intelligence in solving complex and challenging problems with human-like capabilities, such as reasoning and planning in natural languages. Multi-agent coordinated autonomous driving (AD) seems to be a not-so-far future with more AD vehicles of increasing automation running on road [84]. Therefore, further study on the cross-domain MAS is necessary to promote knowledge inspiration and transfer across applications.\nIn this context, multi-agent coordination is the shared key mechanism that underlies the system integration and a force multiplier of MAS. Wooldridge [149] describes it as the defining problem in working together. Particularly, coordination is defined as managing dependencies of agents' activities by Malone et al. [92], which forms a cornerstone of the interdisciplinary coordination theory. On this base, the pervasive clustering phenomenon in MAS can be more easily explained as stemming from the spatio-temporal distribution of agents' multi-level dependencies, like the dynamic relationships in the first-order and higher-order attention mechanisms. Moreover, clustering impacts coordination both logically and physically, including coordinated learning, communication, task allocation, consensus achievement, coalition/team/cluster/group formation, etc. Therefore, the common clustering of agents is actually answering a very fundamental coordination question: who to coordinate with. Then, a subsequent fundamental coordination question is: how to coordinate, i.e., managing dependencies. It is the crucial part of coordinated decision-making and technically relates to learning, adaption, game theory, search, optimization, etc.\nOut of the flourishing results, large amounts of MAS surveys classify coordination algorithms by techniques or tasks, or summarize the tasks of specific algorithmic techniques, such as the consensus algorithms [104], multi-agent planning approaches [141], general multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms [156], application domains of MARL [162], MARL algorithms in Internet [77], and autonomous driving (AV) tasks [94]. However, on one hand, rare survey works explicitly unify the interdisciplinary coordination research from the perspective of \u201cwho to coordinate"}, {"title": "2 A FRAMEWORK FOR MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION", "content": "The definition of multi-agent systems can be as simple as a collection of autonomous agents with common or conflicting interests and information [127]. The community of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) concerns the concurrent artificial intelligence (AI) computations and inherent coordination problems of multiple agents [15]. Russell et al. [119] describe the multi-agent system from the agent's perspective that an agent's performance depends on other entities, which can be treated as other agents apart from the environment. Here, the following definition is sufficient for our purpose, which is consistent with the one in [149]."}, {"title": "2.2 Coordination", "content": "Coordination is an interdisciplinary concept with diverse definitions. For example, Malone et al. [92] gives the definition that \"coordination is managing dependencies between activities\" (tasks) of \"actors\" (agents). Generally, the terms \"coordination\", \"cooperation\" and \"collaboration\" are conceptually different though similar, where the latter two can be seen as approaches to achieve or different forms of the first one. Typical fundamental components in a coordination process are the agents (to be coordinated), overall system-level performance objectives (metrics), and often conflicts of (individual) interests. Therefore, we give the following definition of the multi-agent coordination.\nWe present the multi-agent coordination as agents interact and make decisions for the overall system-level performance, including resolving their conflicted interests. In particular, agents make two essential decisions: who to coordinate with and how to coordinate.\nThe whole coordination process in sequential decision making can be unified in an iterative process consisting of three components: evaluate system-level performance, social choice on who to coordinate with, and how to coordinate. This unified framework is presented in Fig. 3.\nIn the above definition, the first decision problem \"who to coordinate with\" determines the clusters of agents in terms of their inter-dependencies, such as the meta-level structure [37], the coalition [62], and the structured groups of agents [51]. These dependencies may be spatio-temporal different and of different orders, which can be the physical inter-agent spatial distances or the logical decisions. For example, the organization structure of a MAS is a coordination graph that depicts the inter-agent dependencies. In a centralized MAS, all agents"}, {"title": "3 GENERAL MAS", "content": "Generally, a multi-agent system forms a coordination graph where an agent is a node, and an edge represents some kind of interaction or relationship, such as learning, observing, communicating, cooperating, competing, collaborating, or other dependencies. Based on the coordination topology, clusters emerge from some common interests of highly related and dependent agents, such as the same target or mutual benefits. As highlighted in the framework proposed in Section 2, evaluation and clustering determine which agents coordinate with which agents, while updating determines how to coordinate. This section reviews several coordination tasks that are general and important to almost all applications of MAS, which is outlined in Figure 4 and summarized in Table 1.\nIn a MAS, coordination refers to the process by which multiple agents work together, communicate, and adjust their actions to achieve a common goal. Coordination ensures that agents can effectively cooperate, avoid conflicts, and optimize the overall performance of the system by harmonizing their behaviors. The coordinated learning among agents is discussed in Section 3.1, communicating and cooperating is discussed in Section 3.2, and avoiding conflicts is discussed in Section 3.3."}, {"title": "3.1 Coordinated Learning", "content": "The coordinated learning (CL) or social learning of agents answer two questions from the unified perspective: who to learn from and what to learn. In the CL graph, an agent is a node, and an edge exists if there are learning interactions by exchanging information. Extending single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) directly to multi-agent settings makes agents learn independently and is, therefore, called independent learning. It is a disconnected, coordinated learning graph. Though simple, its main issue is the non-stationary problem [87]. In contrast, multi-agent coordinated learning is achieved by utilizing some kind of global state, which may be the ground truth provided by the environment or based on explicit communications that serve as a learning purpose in training (yet such comms are not restricted only in training, but can also be in execution). Past works have proved its benefits in learning efficiency [135, 153].\nCentralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) is a typical coordinated learning paradigm. In the CTDE, agents (policies) work as parallel and decentralized executives collecting sufficient experiences to be communicated to a training center, while the training center works as a data center and learning center where the critic function may access additional information, in which case we call it a centralized critic function. Moreover, the CTDE is often combined with the parameter sharing [56], where a shared (centralized) critic function and, optionally, a shared policy function are centralized learned. Therefore, in the centralized learning of CTDE, agents can be fully connected in terms of coordinated learning, such as multi-agent actor-critic methods MAPPO [153], and value-decomposition methods VDN [134] and QMIX [115], although some of which also support partial connections. Particularly, the credit assignment problem can be alleviated in several ways for heterogeneous agents, such as the works of MADDPG [87], COMA [47], and IC3Net [128]. In addition to the predefined communication contents like local observations, actions, or shared parameters between agents and the training center in CTDE, the coordinated learning can be augmented with direct inter-agent communication protocols that can be learned, such as DIAL [46], BiCNet [108], and SchedNet [66], which will be kept after training. Although some of these works use the broadcasting communication channel, sparse communication may be learned, such as CommNet [131]. Besides, an emerging technique is to model higher-order interaction relationships, such as group-level (or cluster-level) dependencies, along with agent-level interactions in the coordination graph for sparse and weighted inter-agent communications, e.g. LTS-CG [36], GACG [35]. More related work in terms of communication will be introduced in the next topic."}, {"title": "3.2 Communication and Cooperation", "content": "Communication and cooperation are the backbone of MAS, enabling agents to work together effectively toward shared goals. Without communication and cooperation, agents cannot share vital information or synchronize their actions, leading to inefficiencies, conflicts, and resource mismanagement. Therefore, communication can be seen as a rational behavior for coordination [119]. Coordination ensures that agents operate in harmony, optimizing task allocation, resolving conflicts, and enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness.\nThe communication network topology can be seen as a graph $G = (V, E)$, where each agent is a node $v_i \\in V$, and an edge $e_{ij} \\in E$ means there are communications between agent $i$ and agent $j$. The connections among agents form clusters for coordination. However, communication resources are often constrained, which influences the feasibility of coordination algorithms and partly motivates the selective communication as one optimization objective. This part's literature can be categorized by answering two key questions of coordination: which agents to communicate and cooperate with and how agents communicate and cooperate with each other."}, {"title": "3.3 Conflict-of-interest Resolution", "content": "Conflict resolution in multi-agent coordination refers to the process of managing and resolving situations where multiple agents attempt to access shared resources or perform actions in a way that leads to conflicts or collisions, e.g., occupy the same space. Efficient conflict resolution ensures smooth, coordinated behavior while meeting the system's overall goals. An individual agent's own goal represents its interest, while conflicts of interest may occur during interactions among agents and need to be coordinated. Popular resolution mechanisms include path planning (agents plan their paths to avoid conflicts or collisions), resource allocation (agents take turns to access shared resources based on scheduling or priority), behavioral adjustments (agents modify their actions, such as stopping, waiting, or re-routing), etc.\nCoordination issues may cause clustering behaviors of physical collisions, deadlocks 1, and live-locks 2. In particular, collisions may be catastrophic in safety-critical scenarios such as automated warehouses and transportation systems where agents have physical forms (e.g., robots or vehicles). Collision resolution is generally based on some kind of priority, i.e., which conflict to resolve first and which agent should adjust its behavior or yield. As an example of priority-based conflict resolution, it deserves to mention the lexicographic convention [16] in the distributed immediate coordination due to its simplicity, generality, and effectiveness in guaranteeing the safety [132]. However, a common problem of rule-based solutions is that they are hard to provide optimal solutions for all cases in spite that they are often designed case-by-case. Take the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem as an example. The priority of"}, {"title": "4 MAS APPLICATIONS", "content": "This section presents a non-exhaustive list of MAS applications aiming to illustrate its wide spectrum in a unified view, as shown in Table 2. We choose the widely-studied applications largely inspired by the topic areas of MAS surveys in the last five years, which illuminate the contemporary researchers' attention, and highlight emerging and promising applications.\nMulti-agent systems, multi-robot systems (MRS), or swarm systems have proposed new autonomous and intelligent solutions to traditional and beyond traditional applications, such as the multi-robot multi-station system in manufacture [161], robotic sorters in recyclable industrial waste [67], warehouse robots in logistics [25], service and assistance robots in health care (see [11, 13, 106] and references therein), nanorobotics in precision medicine [114], and swarm robots in many future applications [31]. In more detail, an agent or a robot can be an unmanned aerial/ground/underwater vehicle (UAV/UGV/UUV) [1, 61, 163], humanoid robot [120], assistive robot [18] (e.g., smart wheelchair, exoskeleton, pet(-like) robot [14]), snake robot [85], (rigid or soft) crawling/climbing robot [22, 41, 109], sensor node [24], large language model (LLM) [165], etc. The following highlights several state-of-the-art coordination results that are implemented ready for or already used in real-world applications."}, {"title": "4.1 Search and Rescue (SAR)", "content": "Search and rescue (SAR) involves locating and assisting individuals in distress or facing imminent danger. The field encompasses several specialized areas, often defined by the terrain of the operation. Key types include mountain rescue for rugged areas, ground search and rescue, urban search and rescue for incidents in cities, combat search and rescue in battlefield settings, and air-sea rescue for operations over water. Multi-robot systems are useful tools for searching different types of environments. A recent survey has evaluated the current status of multi-robot systems in the context of search and rescue, for more details, please refer to [33].\nThere are many real-world multi-agent SAR applications. For example, swarm robots can be deployed to search for survivors in areas that are dangerous or inaccessible to humans, like earthquake zones or collapsed buildings. Besides, robots can track forest fires, floods, or other environmental hazards [6, 9]. In such tasks, the robots are expected to coordinate and sweep through the environment to search for the targets. A common way is to let the robots form a certain shape (e.g., line shape or V-shape). Such shape formation behavior and sweeping through the environment correspond to \u201cwho to coordinate with\" and \"how to coordinate\" in the unified coordination framework of Fig. 3.\""}, {"title": "4.2 Warehouse Automation and Logistics", "content": "MAS is widely used in warehouse automation and logistics, such as Amazon Robotics\u00b3 (formerly Kiva Systems), Cainiao smart warehouse4, drone delivery [32, 48], etc. Autonomous agents, such as AGVs, manipulators, conveyors, and shuttles, coordinate to streamline tasks like picking, sorting, and transporting goods within the warehouse. Multi-agent coordination is essential for optimizing workflows and ensuring efficient material handling. Effective coordination allows these agents to communicate their positions, share task updates, negotiate resource usage, prevent bottlenecks,"}, {"title": "4.3 Transportation Systems", "content": "In the transportation system, two typical entities that can be modeled as agents are the traffic signal controller and the vehicle controller. The overall system-level performance lies in the traffic and energy efficiency, safety, and mobility accessibility, such as all vehicles' travel time (delay) or average velocity, traffic congestion, and fuel consumption [10, 150].\nFirst, in the traffic signal control problem, an advantage of applying MAS is its (large-scale) problem decomposition capability stemming from its flexible and modular system structure in a hierarchical or fully distributed way [10]. In particular, the concept of road network is employed, where an intersection is a node, the traffic signal timings of which are controlled by an (intersection) agent that, therefore, forms a MAS. The conflict to be resolved in the coordination of multi-agent signal control can be not to further increase the congestion status of adjacent agents.\nSecond, an emerging direction in autonomous driving (AD) is to refocus on its multi-agent nature on top of ego-vehicle tasks like perception, recognition, localization, and maneuver control, such as works in connected autonomous vehicles. One public benefit of investigating AD in the MAS perspective is to consider the transportation system as a whole, contribute to system-level traffic problems, and study their impacts on such as traffic flow, rather than the only standard of local or vehicle-level objectives [150]. Especially in the context of incompatible coordination protocols, the single-agent investigation perspective is not enough and autonomous driving techniques capable of coping with (heterogeneous) multi-agent interaction are inevitable, where agents are diverse, intelligent road users like pedestrians [116], human-driven vehicles, and autonomous vehicles of different automation levels from diverse manufacturers. Examples of coordinated AD tasks are the vehicle platooning [76, 79], cruise control [29], merging [124], navigating through traffic intersections [65], adversarial traffic [144], following, lane changing, and overtaking [154]. For more coordinated task definition and approaches in AV, the readers can refer to the survey [94]."}, {"title": "4.4 Humanoid and Anthropomorphic Robot", "content": "Humanoid robots and robots with anthropomorphic structures are a critical subfield of robotics. They are needed to transfer human skills to robots for assisting or replacing people in such human-centered environments, hazardous scenes, space, or workplaces unreachable by humans [26, 117]. Multi-agent coordination is vital in humanoid and anthropomorphic robots when a single agent is not capable of completing tasks, where an agent is a subsystem of the robot. For example, multi-arm manipulators are more advantageous than a single manipulator in cases of, e.g., grasping relatively heavy, large, or long objects (more examples see [105] and references therein). Furthermore, multi-agent, especially decentralized, solutions are superior in scalability and adaptability performance, such as robustly handling unknown objects of arbitrary geometric and physical properties with malfunctioning components (agents) by various team sizes [57, 117, 136]. The following examples of humanoid and anthropomorphic robots highlight the multi-agent coordination applied in a single robot.\nFor the dual-arm robot, a cooperative grasping means generating optimal grasp pairs based on the combination of grasp poses of each single-arm, i.e., the combinatorial optimization in the joint configuration space, whose dimensionality is determined by the number of independent degrees of freedom (DoF). Successively, the spatio-temporal coordination in manipulation is achieved based on the motion synchronization that trajectories of multiple arms are synchronized in time at some physical positions for such as cooperatively lifting up objects or handover of items (i.e., the associated transition of object control) [7]. Meanwhile, the intrinsic system safety in terms of inter-manipulator collision avoidance is prioritized in motion planning due to their highly overlapping workspaces, apart from the single-arm's capability to avoid collisions with environmental obstacles [28]. Finally, the above coordination requirements can be integrated into one controller's design by, e.g., the multi-objective optimization [117], or solved by multi-agent decentralized control for scalable multi-arm systems [57].\nBesides, the dexterous (multi-fingered) (humanoid) robot hand is irreplaceable or advantageous than the (multi-)arm alone in manipulation tasks that need, such as compensation for the limited arm functionality or in-hand dexterity (e.g., fine manipulation other than grasping). The definition of dexterity is often related to the generality concerning the set of tasks that can be accomplished and the overall system-level performance of manipulator(s) (see discussions in [90]). For the anthropomorphic hand, dexterous tasks are typical to emulate coordinated human behaviors [19, 43], which can be evaluated in a qualitative or open quantitative manner. The dexterity is achieved by the kinematic redundancy brought by the multi-finger and their coordination. The manipulation policy is usually centralized, i.e., one controller for all actuators [5], in spite of the many independently controlled/actuated DoF. As with any centralized MAS, such centralized motion planners are vulnerable to individual component malfunction, are robot-structure-specific and object-specific [136], and suffer from poor scalability. Accordingly, decentralized control of multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches emerge [136, 148], where a finger can be an agent.\nFurthermore, a humanoid robot is a more complex multi-agent system that involves higher-order relationships of subsystems for a coordinated robot's reaction or decision-making. For instance, a humanoid robot's coordination can refer to task decomposition and task transition between subsystems, such as in mobile manipulation tasks. The coordinated head-eye movements of a humanoid robot can describe that the motions of the head and eye are compensatory in the active perception, e.g., the head in clockwise and the eye in anti-clockwise when looking at a fixed point in the scene [71]. Besides, the humanoid robot's coordination can happen between multi-modal sensors. For example, the capability limitations of a moving robot's visual perception can be addressed by the acoustic (localization) system in tracking humans in the surroundings [7]. The humanoid robotic tactile-sensing skin can be a network of multi-modal sensor modules with local controllers for preprocessing signals and routing data, which are then fused into robot reactions [99]. In this sense, it is a multi-agent system with sensor fusion coordination problems."}, {"title": "4.5 Satellite Systems", "content": "Satellite services play a crucial role in the ongoing revolution of the space industry with the advent of New Space [69, 96]. Distributed space systems (DSS) are naturally multi-agent systems (MAS), such as satellite formation flying (e.g., trailing), satellite cluster, satellite constellation, fractionated satellite, and satellite swarm [113, 133]. As agents in DSS, satellites can be classified based on the orbit's altitude and satellite mass, including Geostationary (GEO) / Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) / Low Earth Orbit (LEO) / Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) satellites and small satellites: mini/micro/nano(cube)/pico/femto-satellite [69, 113]. The following brief surveys the MAS in three DSS.\nFirst, in the constellation, satellites in different orbital planes coordinate to provide the desired service coverage, which may be global, regional, cellular, or demand-based. The continuity of coverage service is optional due to the relative movement of non-GEO satellites to the Earth and the number of satellites. The constellation design is typically a many-objective optimization or constrained optimization problem, which is evaluated by area coverage-based metrics (e.g., coverage probability), coverage gap-based metrics (e.g., revisit time), cost-based metrics (e.g, number of satellites, number of orbital planes or altitude), and communication-based metrics and constraints (e.g., latency, propagation path loss, radio resources, co-channel interference, noise level, and Doppler frequency offset/drift) [3, 123, 129]. For instance, SpaceX proposes three technical modifications to its Starlink constellation configuration to facilitate its broadband internet service deployment together with increasing orbital debris mitigation and space safety (e.g., collision risk) [137-139].\nSecond, the satellite swarm is an open, promising, and active research topic [42, 69, 113], which has attracted much researchers' attention since 2000s [38]. As with other swarm systems, it is defined in terms of the key features of self-organization mechanism, coordinated behavior, and a common objective (distributed space mission) [133]. This configuration is often related with the small satellite field due to the mass production and deployment requirements for a swarm, such as the constellation of 4 hierarchical swarms of total 28 small satellites in the Magnetic Nano-Probe Swarm mission [88], the swarm of 36 cubesats in the QB50 project [110], and the swarm of 50 nano-satellites in the radio telescope project OLFAR [39]. General multi-agent tasks and challenges apply in satellite swarm missions, such as the mission scheduling and planning [159], consensus [121], synchronization [95], remote sensing [42], collision avoidance [101], and target tracking and navigation (e.g., in asteroid characterization [130]). However, the work in the satellite swarm is still limited, and more researches are expected to empower the swarm and demonstrate the swarm's advantageous properties in more scenarios.\nThird, in satellite communications, many multi-agent (sequential) decision-making problems and coordination tasks are vital for domain innovation and advancement with the natural advantages of reconfigurable, scalable, upgradable, robust, and low complexity from distributed control. For example, in optimizing the radio resources (spectrum, interference) and system performance (including load balancing), multi-agent beam hopping (scheduling) methods are proposed for the multi-beam satellite system [82], multi-satellite multi-beam system [83, 164], and construction of phased array antenna [112], where an agent may control a beam parameter, a satellite's multiple beams, or a cubesat in a flying swarm. Besides, routing in networks involving satellites is different from that in terrestrial networks due to the time-varying topology (including predictable regular changes and unpredictable link or node failures), frequent connection switching, and propagation delay arising from the satellites' moving and space environment. An advantage of distributed routing protocols is their demonstrated scalability in thousands of satellites [89, 157]. Challenges in this direction include routing in hierarchical/vertical space networks with heterogeneous link connections and Space Internet with long distance and high delay communication links [69]."}, {"title": "4.6 LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems", "content": "Large language model (LLM) agents have increasingly demonstrated human-level performance in a variety of activities, such as reasoning, planning, and problem-solving. Inspired by their surprising capabilities, various LLM-based multi-agent systems have been proposed to leverage the collective intelligence and specialized profiles and skills of different agents to solve more complex and challenging problems, e.g., software development, society simulation, and autonomous driving, in which multiple agents need to collaboratively engage in discussions, reasoning, and planning. This process mimics the intelligent behaviors of human/animal group work in problem-solving tasks. According to different application domains, existing work can be roughly categorized into two classes, including decision-making and behavior simulation. We elaborate on them below."}, {"title": "5 FUTURE AND OPEN TOPICS", "content": "The multi-agent perspective offers the capabilities of modeling complex systems with complex interactions through problem decomposition, decentralized control and emerging swarm intelligence from distributed computational intelligence. Despite substantial progress in the field of multi-agent systems (MAS) and coordination mechanisms, several key challenges remain, offering opportunities for future research."}, {"title": "5.1 Scalability and Hybrid Coordination", "content": "Scalability remains a critical challenge for future research in multi-agent coordination as the scale of the problem increases. When the number of agents grows significantly, evaluating conflicts, clustering agents, and dynamically updating strategies all become increasingly complex. Traditional methods may struggle to maintain efficiency and computational feasibility, leading to delays or suboptimal performance. Therefore, how to efficiently tackle the large-scale coordination problem would be the first concern. In turn, the multi-agent coordination is scalable if the (system-level) performance improves proportionately or will not degrade with the scale of agents, which motivates the large-scale deployment. Then, how to coordinate and learn at scale by taking advantage of the scalable computational resources, information, or experiences (datasets) provided by a large amount of (distributed) agents would be another concern.\nFrom the unified perspective, the hybridization of hierarchical and decentralized mechanisms is a practical solution and promising open direction. First, hierarchical structures exist in nature and human behaviors. Multi-agent systems can incorporate hierarchical mechanisms as a crucial complementary or part of the self-organization. The hierarchical mechanism assigns greater responsibilities to some agents, allowing the MAS to adapt flexibly to the demands of the task at hand. Therefore, hierarchy enables scalability and efficient management of large-scale MAS. A similar idea is discussed by Mariani et al. [94] and Vasirani and Ossowski [143] in autonomous driving that propose to select representative vehicles or software agents as regional leaders in the road (infrastructure) network taking charge of regional demands and altogether optimizing the overall traffic. Besides, Rizk et al. [118] points out that hierarchical approaches promote the scalability by supporting diverse interaction densities from the local and global scales. Second, decentralization enhances robustness and adaptability. The hybrid approaches strike a balance between the strengths of hierarchical and decentralized approaches, providing the scalability and global coordination of a hierarchical system while maintaining the local adaptability and resilience of a decentralized one. This allows MAS to handle complex tasks with greater efficiency, ensuring swift local decision-making while maintaining overall system coherence, making it ideal for large and dynamic environments."}, {"title": "5.2 Heterogeneity and Human-MAS Coordination", "content": "Most existing MAS are homogeneous and have a limited ability to solve complex tasks. In addition, to solve tasks more efficiently, specialization is very essential. Thus, we believe that heterogeneous MAS (including physical, behavioral, or logical heterogeneity) with specialized agents is a promising research direction. In such a heterogeneous MAS, agents play different roles and have different capabilities. This brings an additional degree of freedom for the flexibility in coordination. Recently, substantial experimental results have been achieved by LLM-based heterogeneous MAS in solving various language-based AI tasks [49, 52, 72, 107, 111, 165]. However, heterogeneity means that not all agents coordinate in the same way as in homogeneous MAS. This challenges the coordination of heterogeneous MAS, since homogeneity may be the simplest mechanism for forming self-organized patterns. In particular, humans, as a kind of agent with incentives and emotions, play an important role and can be passively or proactively involved in coordination, which can be respectively called the human-MAS interaction and human-MAS teaming in this context.\nFor the human-MAS interaction, for example, mixed traffic is a passive coordinated heterogeneous MAS, where pedestrians, bicycle riders, motorcycle riders, horse riders, human-driven vehicles, partial and fully autonomous vehicles are passively accounted for by each other since they are heterogeneous with respect to their coordination protocols, yet share the road with some common goals like keeping mutual mobility and safety. The research on autonomous driving (AD) has investigated being aware of and paying attention to human road users through scene representation [23] and investigated the impacts of applying AD. But how to effectively coordinate with heterogeneous agents regarding complex inter-agent dependencies has not been extensively studied in coordinated multi-agent AD, especially under the system-level considerations that will not break societal norms and expectations by introducing autonomous vehicles, apart from the whole system efficiency, fairness, emergency priority, etc.\nFor the human-MAS teaming, human agents proactively engage in coordinated decision-making with Al agents by teleoperation or supervisory control. It is typically termed the human-swarm interaction (HSI) in the literature [31, 70]. This human-centric heterogeneous MAS fuses the abstract human intelligence and enables the injection of human intent into AI MAS, extends the potential of each other and exploits the complementary capabilities of humans and machines. Such solutions are crucial for the fifth industrial revolution and future MAS advantages. Many human-MAS interaction techniques have been explored (see [4, 64, 70, 80, 81, 142, 146]), including graphical interfaces, gesture recognition, touch feedback, voice recognition, eye movement, etc. Particularly, the natural brain-computer interface (nBCI) [4, 64, 146] has emerged as a promising technology for natural and hands-free interaction, especially in applications involving wearable devices. nBCI leverages neural signals to enable seamless communication between humans and machines, thereby enhancing interaction efficiency in human-MAS systems. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of nBCI in human-MAS interaction. For example, Wang et al. [146] proposed a novel error-related potential (ErrP)-based nBCI for implicit robot control, where human responses to unexpected robot actions were translated into corrective commands, enabling real-time closed-loop interaction without explicit input. Additionally, Aldini et al. [4], John et al. [64] integrated cognitive conflict detection based on EEG signals into physical human-robot collaboration to assess human responses under unexpected robot behaviors, demonstrating that nBCI can effectively monitor human cognitive states to support adaptive robot control. These studies collectively highlight the potential of nBCI to enhance human-MAS interaction by providing real-time cognitive feedback for adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments.\nLast, the key to maximize the above potential is the superior coordination process with two promising and challenging directions in co-learning and trustworthy. Computational trust modeling [80, 81, 145] has been proposed to facilitate reliable and adaptive collaboration between human agents and machine agents in human-MAS systems. Trust modeling involves assessing the trustworthiness of agents and adapting interactions accordingly to ensure efficient and safe collaboration. For example, Lin et al. [80, 81] introduced trust models based on reinforcement-learning-based fusion, enabling MAS to dynamically adjust their behaviours according to human feedback and past experiences. Wang et al. [145] investigated trust-based role arbitration in human-robot teams, where trust levels determine role assignments and decision-making authority, thereby enhancing collaboration under dynamic conditions. These advancements in computational trust modeling are pivotal for human-centric MAS, as they not only improve team performance but also foster human acceptance and confidence in MAS technologies."}, {"title": "5.3 Learning and LLM-based MAS", "content": "Recent LLM-based MAS such as GPTSwarm [166], MetaGPT [59] and swarm have shown the ability to solve different tasks. Popular LLM-based MAS frameworks include AutoGen7, LangChain, AutoGPT, LangGraph10, CrewAI11, etc. Looking ahead, building applications upon LLM-based MAS will play a crucial role in both academia and industry. Furthermore, the LLM-based MAS will make Al agents more intelligent and helpful in human society. We believe that the LLM-based MAS is a trend. This is only the beginning, with much more exciting progress to come.\nIn essence, the working functionality of LLMs is to fit the complex statistical model into the huge training dataset or joint state space for MAS. As a result, like all other machine learning techniques, LLMs can also suffer from the poor generalization ability (e.g., hallucination) if the training dataset or joint state space cannot cover the cases of interest well. Furthermore, the training process of LLMs is often expensive in terms of both economic and labor costs."}, {"title": "6 CONCLUSION", "content": "The MAS perspective and coordination capability have already reformed and will further revolutionize diverse applications. This survey provides a unified insight into the interdisciplinary MAS coordination by analyzing and answering four fundamental questions: (1) what is coordination; (2) why coordination; (3) who to coordinate with; and (4) how to coordinate. Particularly, three general MAS coordination problems and six MAS applications are surveyed, which cover fundamental common tasks, widely studied domains, and newly emerged areas. Given on the above efforts, three future directions: hybridization of hierarchical and decentralized coordination, human-MAS coordination, and LLM-based MAS are explored for three open MAS performance: scalability, heterogeneity, and learning mechanism. We anticipate that multi-agent coordination will drive a new stage of general AI."}]}

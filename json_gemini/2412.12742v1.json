However, the presence of both cardiac and respiratory motion makes it challenging to acquire and reconstruct high-quality images, as achieving high spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously remains difficult [39]. Therefore, fast data acquisition with high undersampling rates in the MR signal space, also called k-space, has attracted great interest in the field of reconstruction.\nReconstruction of images from undersampled k-space data has been significantly advanced by the introduction of parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS) techniques in MRI. These approaches have driven substantial improvements in acquisition efficiency, leveraging both hardware and algorithmic innovations. PI utilizes multiple receiver coils in MRI scanners, exploiting the redundancy among coils to enable higher undersampling rates during data acquisition. In contrast, CS incorporates sparse priors as regularization terms to constrain the solution space and mitigate the risk of local minima in the reconstruction process. Building upon these foundations, the development of low-rank and subspace methods has opened up new avenues for dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction [23,7,28,12]. By explicitly leveraging the low-rank structure across temporal phases, these approaches model the cardiac motion as lying close to a lower-dimensional manifold, which can be spanned by just a few temporal basis functions. This effective dimensionality reduction not only simplifies the reconstruction problem but also enables the use of fewer measurements, ultimately improving scan efficiency. As a result, both spatial and temporal information are faithfully recovered, facilitating more accurate representations of the underlying cardiac motion. More recently, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable potential in leveraging acquisition physics and raw k-space data for improved reconstruction [35,14,32,16,19,30,29]. Despite their success, most of these methods are supervised and require large, fully-sampled training datasets, and consequently prone to hallucinations when there are domain shifts. Several approaches that do not require fully sampled data have been proposed [2,45,15,9,20,8], and while recent work has begun to address radial sampling [3,24], the majority of these methods have been developed primarily for Cartesian sampling trajectories.\nNon-Cartesian sampling techniques, such as radial sampling, have become increasingly popular. Unlike Cartesian sampling, non-Cartesian approaches vary both phase encoding directions simultaneously, which helps to distribute motion- and undersampling-related noise throughout the image, leading to more incoherent and less prominent artifacts [44]. This property makes non-Cartesian sampling particularly well-suited for cardiac cine MRI, especially in patients with irregular heart rhythms. However, non-Cartesian sampling introduces new challenges. Reconstruction from non-Cartesian data requires non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT), which can be computationally expensive and affected by density compensation and interpolation errors [31,44]. Due to the moving nature of the heart and the limitations of MR physics, only a limited number of data points can be rapidly sampled for each motion state in cardiac cine MRI. Existing methods typically rely on binning k-space samples along the temporal dimension into a fixed number of motion states to achieve high image quality for each cardiac frame [1,18,34,43]. Binning of real-time data simplifies data representation and optimization, but results in a loss of temporal information.\nIn recent developments, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have shown impressive potential to represent continuous signals through coordinate-value mappings using multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) [6,38,25,26]. The flexibility of INRs to sample at arbitrary locations makes them ideal to reconstruct images from non-Cartesian sampling trajectories without the need for NUFFT, and the ability of continuous representation is ideal for learning the continuous spatiotemporal information in cardiac cine MRI. Previous studies show the effectiveness of INRs for both Cartesian [10,37,21] and non-Cartesian sampling [5], but cardiac cine MRI methods still either rely on binned data [5] or attempt to directly learn the entire spatiotemporal space [17,41,13,40], which is particularly challenging under sparse sampling schemes.\nDespite significant progress in cardiac cine MRI reconstruction, achieving high-quality images for real-time cardiac cine MRI under sparse sampling conditions remains a challenging task. Traditional binning-based approaches sacrifice temporal resolution by grouping data into discrete motion states, while non-Cartesian sampling often relies on computationally expensive and error-prone NUFFT operations. Moreover, directly modeling the full spatiotemporal domain of the beating heart can overwhelm reconstruction algorithms, particularly when acquired data are limited. To overcome these hurdles, we propose a novel approach that exploits the inherent low-rank structure of cardiac cine MRI through the integration of subspace learning and INRs. By avoiding binning and NUFFT altogether, our approach enables efficient, high-quality reconstruction that preserves crucial cardiac dynamics. Our main contributions are as follows:\n1.  We introduce a reconstruction pipeline that tailored for radially sampled real-time cardiac cine MRI that removes the need for temporal binning and avoids the limitations of NUFFT.\n2.  We propose a subspace learning strategy that directly exploits the low-rank properties of cardiac cine data. By representing the data as a combination of spatial and temporal bases, we effectively reduce the dimensionality of the representation space. This reduction enables our approach to employ INRS to accurately learn these representations, thereby capturing intricate details of cardiac motion.\n3.  Our framework achieves superior reconstruction of both spatial details and temporal motion compared to conventional binning-based methods, delivering improved image quality and more faithful depictions of cardiac function."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "This section presents our proposed reconstruction framework for real-time cardiac cine MRI, integrating INRs and subspace learning.

The following subsections detail the problem formulation, the INR-based reconstruction strategy, and the integration of low-rank properties for efficient representation."}, {"title": "2.1 Cardiac Cine MRI with Continuous Radial Sampling", "content": "The raw signal of cardiac cine MRI with continuous radial sampling trajectories is acquired for each spoke in the k-space (frequency domain). The goal of MRI reconstruction is to recover the optimal image $x^*$ by solving:\n$x^* = arg min DC(x, y) + R(x)$.\nHere $DC(x, y)$ enforces data consistency between the reconstructed image $x$ and the k-space measurements $y$, and $R(x)$ is a regularization term. Each spoke $x_i$, $i = 1,2,..., N$ (N for total number of spokes), sampled at time intervals defined by the repetition time (TR), represents k-space information from a single moment in time. However, it is impossible to reconstruct an image frame from a single spoke due to the extreme sparsity of information. Conventionally, neighboring k-space spokes (in time) are grouped into segments using a binning operator $B$, and the data consistency term is defined as:\n$DC'(x, y) = ||Ax - By||_2$,\nwhere $A = MFS$, representing the undersampling mask $M$, NUFFT operator $F$, and coil sensitivity maps $S$. To encounter the lack of measurements per time point and the resulting undersampling in the spatial domain, the binning operator $B$ aggregates neighboring spokes from various time points (see various colors in 1a). For larger bin sizes, more cardiac motion is averaged within one frame, which in turn can lead to an increased motion blurring in the reconstructed image. Therefore, there will be an unavoidable trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution when using binning."}, {"title": "2.2 Implicit Neural Representations for MRI Reconstruction", "content": "To fully utilize the temporal information encoded in the acquired k-space spokes, an ideal approach would reconstruct N image frames, each corresponding to a single spoke, eliminating the temporal information loss from the binning operator B. This modifies the data consistency term to:\n$DC(x, y) = ||Ax - y||_2$.\nHowever, the direct application of NUFFT to each spoke results in suboptimal reconstructions. To avoid that, we represent the image $x$ as a continuous function using an INR network, $x = G_\\theta(c)$, where $c = \\{C_i = [x_i, y_i, t_i]^T, i = 1,2,..., M\\}$ denotes coordinates in the spatiotemporal space, and $G_\\theta(): R^3 \\rightarrow C$ is the INR network mapping from the spatiotemporal coordinates to the complex image voxel value. The optimal reconstruction is then obtained by optimizing the network parameters $\\theta$:\n$\\theta^* = arg min DC(G_\\theta(c), y) + R(G_\\theta(c))$,\n$x^* = G_{\\theta^*}(C_{grid})$,\nwhere $\\theta^*$ represents the optimal parameters of the INR network, $c_{grid}$ represents the coordinates of a target MRI image on a Cartesian grid.\nThe sparsity of k-space, as well as the high-dimensional x-y-t image space, poses a challenge for learning a well-represented INR. To address this, we leverage the inherent temporal redundancies of cardiac cine MRI by integrating a compact subspace into the INR training. Inspired by the low-rank representations of cardiac cine MRI, where the dynamic image can be approximated by the product of two low-rank matrices (e.g., top-k components) - spatial bases and temporal bases - we decompose the dynamic image into these two components. The image is decomposed into spatial and temporal bases, modeled by two networks: $G_{\\theta_s}(s)$ for spatial representation and $G_{\\theta_t}(t)$ for temporal representation. The optimization problem is reformulated as:\n$\\theta_{\\theta_s}, \\theta_{\\theta_t} = arg min DC(G_{\\theta_s}(s) \\cdot G_{\\theta_t}(t)) + R_s(G_{\\theta_s}(s)) + R_t(G_{\\theta_t}(t))$,\n$x^* = G_{\\theta_s}(s) \\cdot G_{\\theta_t}(t)$."}, {"title": "2.3 Network Initialization and Optimization", "content": "Proper initialization is critical for fast convergence. Inspired by [12,33], we first reconstruct a low-resolution image using GRASP [11], aggregating the central spokes of low spatial and temporal resolution. This low-resolution image is decomposed via singular value decomposition (SVD), retaining the top-k components (Figure 1b), which are interpolated to full resolution using linear interpolation. The spatial and temporal networks are initialized by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between their outputs and these interpolated bases (Figure 1c). Subsequently, the network parameters are optimized by minimizing Eq. 5. Once trained, the reconstructed image is obtained by inputting the x-y-t grid $c_{grid}$ into the networks. Figure 1d and e illustrate the fine-tuning and inference steps of the proposed method."}, {"title": "3 Experimental Setup", "content": "Experiments were conducted on 17 healthy subjects using a 1.5T scanner (Ingenia, Philips, Best, The Netherlands) with 28 MR receiver coils. To reduce training time, we used data from 6 selected coils sensitive to the heart region. All experiments were IRB-approved with written informed consent. The following sequence parameters were used: 7-8 short axis slices; FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm\u00b2 (considering inherent 1.6\u00d7 frequency encoding oversampling of radial trajectories); 8 mm slice thickness; resolution = 2 \u00d7 2 mm\u00b2; TE/TR = 1.16/2.3 ms; b-SSFP readout; radial tiny golden angle of ~23.6\u00b0; flip angle 60\u00b0; 8960 acquired radial spokes (800 spokes were used, covering 2-3 cardiac cycles) without ECG gating; nominal scan time ~20s (~1.8s for 800 spokes); breath-hold acquisition. No fully-sampled ground truth images are available in this real-time acquisition setting.\nThe proposed INR framework consists of a spatial network and a temporal network. Both networks are based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with hash-grid encoding [26]. The hash-grid encoding uses a hashmap of size 20 with 16 levels, 2 features per level, a base resolution of 16, and a per-level scale of 1.26. The MLPs have 2 hidden layers, each containing 64 nodes. The number of main components k is set to 6 for both spatial and temporal bases. The networks generate an output dimension of 12, which represents the concatenation of the real and imaginary parts of the basis components.\nThe low-resolution image (1/2.56 of the original resolution) was reconstructed using GRASP [11,42] with 100 iterations on binned spoke centers. Binning was performed with 20 spokes per phase and a total variation regularization weight of 0.025. By cropping the center of the radial k-space for the low-resolution reconstruction, sparsity towards the outside k-space can be reduced. Thus, the effective acceleration factor is reduced, resulting in low-resolution reconstructions with minimized undersampling artefacts [10]. SVD was applied to the image, decomposing it into spatial bases and temporal bases. Then we retained the top 6 components for further processing. The temporal and spatial bases were interpolated to resolutions of 2.56 times and 20 times their original sizes, respectively, to match the full spatial resolution and maximum temporal resolution (TR). The spatial and temporal networks were trained on these interpolated bases for 1000 steps with a learning rate of 0.01, using MSE loss."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "Table 1 summarizes the mean and standard deviation of the quantitative results for systole and diastole phases. For SNR, the proposed method outperformed the comparison methods by a considerable margin in both systolic and diastolic phases, reflecting its ability to maintain a higher SNR during dynamic cardiac motion. For ES, the proposed method showed a notable advantage in the systolic phase and comparable performance in the diastolic phase, indicating its capability to preserve edge sharpness under different motion conditions.\nFigure 2a and b present qualitative comparisons between NUFFT, GRASP, and the proposed method for two representative cases. Higher temporal resolutions (fewer spokes per frame) are compared to higher spatial resolutions (more spokes per frame). Qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method preserves finer spatial details and richer temporal fidelity compared to binned approaches, with negligible motion blur. In the region of interest, our method retains intricate details that are blurred in the reconstructions of binned methods (NUFFT and GRASP) marked by yellow arrows. This difference can be attributed to the averaging of neighboring time frames in binned methods, which introduces spatial and temporal blurring. The x-t profiles further illustrate that binning leads to noticeable temporal blurring, while the proposed reconstruction framework effectively preserves temporal continuity, offering clear visualization of dynamic cardiac motion.\nFigures 3a and b illustrate the first four components of temporal and spatial bases learned by the networks under three different settings: low-resolution initialization only, fine-tuned results based on low-resolution initialization, and directly learned bases without low-resolution initialization. By comparing the results of directly learned and fine-tuned bases, we observe that without initialization, the INRs struggle to learn the spatiotemporal information, particularly failing to capture the temporal details. This highlights that initialization is crucial for achieving fast convergence and effective representation learning in our proposed method. Comparing the initialized and fine-tuned bases, we notice that the spatial bases initially appear blurry and lack fine details, as they are generated from low-resolution reconstructions during the initialization phase. After fine-tuning on the non-binned k-space spokes, the spatial bases exhibit significantly enhanced clarity, and the temporal bases recover fine details that were previously lost. These results validate our hypothesis that the INR framework, combined with fine-tuning, effectively recovers high-frequency spatial and temporal information. This comparison further demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging the low-rank property of cardiac cine MRI within the INR framework.\nIn summary, both qualitative and quantitative evaluations indicate that the proposed method achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to conventional NUFFT and GRASP methods. By preserving both spatial and temporal details, the proposed framework demonstrates significant advantages for the reconstruction of real-time cardiac cine MRI. The results suggest that this approach is particularly well-suited for capturing dynamic cardiac events, providing high-quality reconstructions without the need for binning or NUFFT."}, {"title": "5 Discussion and Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we presented a novel subspace INR framework for the reconstruction of real-time cardiac cine MRI. Conventional approaches often rely on binning k-space data to handle motion. Similarily, they often rely on non-uniform FFT (NUFFT) to handle non-Cartesian sampling trajectories. While effective in certain scenarios, these methods face inherent limitations, such as losing temporal resolution due to binning and reconstruction artifacts arising from NUFFT density compensation and interpolation errors. Our framework addresses these challenges by leveraging subspace learning with INRs, eliminating the need for both binning and NUFFT. Our proposed method exploits low-rank properties of cardiac cine MRI, enabling accurate and data-efficient reconstruction from sparse k-space samples without compromising spatial or temporal resolution.\nThe foundation of our method lies in decomposing the spatiotemporal image into separate spatial and temporal bases represented by two distinct INR networks. This decomposition reduces the complexity of the reconstruction problem by projecting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal space into a lower-dimensional subspace, significantly improving data efficiency. The networks are initialized using low-resolution reconstructions obtained via GRASP, ensuring stable and reliable starting points. Fine-tuning networks with spoke-specific losses recovers fine details lost at initialization, resulting in superior image quality. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional binning-based approaches, better preserving temporal dynamics and finer spatial details. Additionally, the flexibility of INR-based representations allows the reconstruction of continuous cardiac motion, effectively minimizing motion artifacts that are common in conventional methods.\nOne of the key contributions of this work is a paradigm shift in the preprocessing of k-space data. Instead of treating groups of k-space measurements, such as binned spokes, as the minimal unit, we explored treating individual spokes as the minimal unit. This approach unlocks the potential to achieve a temporal resolution equal to the repetition time (TR). While similar concepts have been explored for implicit neural representations in k-space [17], our work extends the representation to image space while retaining the spoke-wise minimal unit through the use of the Fourier slicing theorem, showcasing its utility for real-time cardiac cine MRI. Furthermore, this concept is not limited to cardiac imaging, but can be generalized to multi-contrast imaging and other quantitative MRI applications, highlighting its broad potential impact.\nDespite its very promising results, this study still has some limitations. First, while training and inference times have been reduced to approximately 15 minutes, this remains a bottleneck for clinical routine use. Second, the method requires training and additional optimization for each new scan, which prevents direct inference on unseen data. Although this scan-specific approach minimizes the risk of inpainting artifacts from training data, it introduces potential issues with overfitting. The current stopping criteria for the number of iterations are empirically determined and may not always be optimal. Lastly, our evaluation focused on imaging quality metrics; further studies are needed to assess the method's performance on more clinical parameters. These limitations underscore the need for continued refinement and validation.\nFuture work will focus on optimizing the spatial and temporal network architectures to improve computational efficiency and scalability. This is particularly important for extending the approach to higher-dimensional problems, such as 4D MRI, where the trade-off between data acquisition time and resolution is even more pronounced. Expanding the framework to other applications and imaging modalities, such as functional MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), could further demonstrate its versatility and applicability across the broader field of medical imaging. Finally, rigorous clinical validation, including evaluations on pathological cases and diverse multi-institution datasets, will be critical to ensure its practical utility in real-world clinical settings.\nIn conclusion, the proposed subspace INR framework represents a significant step forward in real-time cardiac cine MRI reconstruction. By overcoming the limitations of binning and NUFFT, our method preserves both spatial and temporal fidelity, enabling high-quality imaging of dynamic cardiac events. With further development and clinical validation, this approach has the potential to transform real-time cardiac cine MRI and expand its applications across a range of imaging scenarios."}]}

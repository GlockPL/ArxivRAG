{"title": "Rethinking AI Cultural Evaluation", "authors": ["Michal Bravansky", "Filip Trhlik", "Fazl Barez"], "abstract": "As AI systems become more integrated into society, evaluating their capacity to align with diverse cultural values is crucial for their responsible deployment. Current evaluation methods predominantly rely on multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets. In this study, we demonstrate that MCQs are insufficient for capturing the complexity of cultural values expressed in open-ended scenarios. Our findings highlight significant discrepancies between MCQ-based assessments and the values conveyed in unconstrained interactions. Based on these findings, we recommend moving beyond MCQs to adopt more open-ended, context-specific assessments that better reflect how AI models engage with cultural values in realistic settings.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction & Related Works", "content": "The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) can largely be attributed to their ability to follow and adapt to user requests [Ouyang et al., 2022]. One key aspect of this adaptability is cultural alignment, which refers to an LLM's ability to adjust to specific cultural contexts and respond in a way that reflects the values, opinions, and knowledge relevant to that culture [Barez and Torr, 2023, Kasirzadeh and Gabriel, 2023, AlKhamissi et al., 2024, Masoud et al., 2023]. Achieving accurate cultural alignment in LLMs can enhance their effectiveness in creative writing [Shakeri et al., 2021], therapy [Wang et al., 2021], translation [Yao et al., 2023], or human modeling [Argyle et al., 2023].\nA common method for evaluating cultural alignment involves opinion surveys like the Global Values Survey and Pew Surveys [Solaiman et al., 2023]. These surveys often form the basis for multiple-choice questions (MCQ) that assess an LLM's alignment with specific cultural values by comparing its responses to human results [Santurkar et al., 2023, AlKhamissi et al., 2024, Kwok et al., 2024].\nHowever, recent advances suggest that MCQ evaluations may be an ineffective proxy for assessing true values expressed by LLMs. Firstly, users discussing value-laden topics with LLMs do not typically employ a questionnaire-style format [Ouyang et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2024, Zheng et al., 2023]. Furthermore, R\u00f6ttger et al. [2024] demonstrates that political opinions expressed in open-ended settings are not adequately represented in multiple-choice questionnaires. Similarly, Trhlik and Stenetorp [2024] observed that such discrepancies also occur in the classification of political content.\nTo investigate whether MCQs provide an inaccurate proxy for assessing cultural alignment, we conducted a comparison between the model's responses in MCQ evaluations and the values expressed in more open-ended, unconstrained settings, adapting the experimental setup used by R\u00f6ttger et al. [2024]. In our study, we prompted the model with the instruction: \"From now on, respond as someone from [country] would,\" and evaluated its responses against a dataset of country-specific cultural values from Durmus et al. [2023]. Our findings indicate that survey-based evaluations of cultural values fail to accurately capture the cultural alignment expressed by the model in realistic, open-ended"}, {"title": "Experiment", "content": "scenarios. Based on these results, we argue that the NLP community should move away from MCQ evaluations and instead adopt more context-specific, open-ended assessments that better reflect how models engage with cultural values in real-world interactions."}, {"title": "Discussion", "content": "Our results indicate that questionnaires are inadequate for fully capturing the behavior of LLMs in relation to expressed cultural values. Therefore, we propose several recommendations to help the research community improve the evaluation of cultural alignment.\n(1) Address Response Bias in Survey-Based Evaluations Survey-based methods often restrict models to predefined answers, limiting their ability to express uncertainty or neutrality. This forced-choice format can create artificial alignment, as models may select an option despite preferring to withhold judgment or express ambiguity [Tourangeau, 2000]. To address this issue, future evaluations should allow models to withhold responses or indicate uncertainty, ideally through freeform generations, and incorporate these behaviors into the evaluation criteria.\n(2) Develop Use Case-Specific Evaluation Frameworks There is no single evaluation method capable of assessing all cultural values across varied tasks and scenarios. Different evaluation techniques, such as open-ended versus classification tasks, can reveal different biases. This supports the view that LLMs are simulating different sets of characters in various contexts [Shanahan et al., 2023]. We recommend focusing on building tailored evaluation frameworks for high-stakes areas like hiring, criminal justice, and healthcare, where cultural alignment is critical [Ferrara, 2023].\n(3) Take a Holistic Approach to Model Behavior Refusals and ambiguous answers should be seen as valuable data points, as they can reveal deeper, context-specific biases [Urman and Makhortykh, 2023, Motoki et al., 2023]. For instance, our findings show significant variation in the frequency of ambiguous responses across different countries. We recommend that researchers analyze these behaviors alongside broader cultural alignment to gain a better understanding of a model's biases."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "This study demonstrates that MCQ-style evaluations are inadequate for accurately measuring the cultural alignment of LLMs in open-ended settings. To address these limitations, we recommend several strategies, including allowing models to withhold responses or indicate uncertainty, developing evaluation frameworks tailored to specific use cases, and adopting a holistic view of model behavior."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "The primary limitation of our study is the use of a single model, GPT-40. While this model offers valuable insights into the limitations of MCQ evaluations, our findings may not generalize to other LLMs. Furthermore, although similarity to human values is a useful metric for assessing alignment, it may inadvertently amplify existing human biases. Future evaluations and experiments should carefully consider this risk to avoid reinforcing these biases.\nAdditionally, while we have proposed general recommendations for improving cultural alignment evaluation, these suggestions still require further validation. Future research should focus on develop-ing practical methodologies and validating these recommendations to ensure their broad applicability and effectiveness within the research community."}, {"title": "Experimental Setup", "content": "Following the experimental setup described in R\u00f6ttger et al. [2024], we employed three different prompting techniques with varying levels of constraint. In all experiments, we used a temperature of 0.7 and a top-p value of 1.\nWe utilized the GlobalOpinionQA dataset [Durmus et al., 2023] and filtered all the questions that included human response data for four selected countries: the United States, China, Japan, and India. We further restricted our dataset to questions that offered only two response options, resulting in a final set of 72 questions. This limitation of focusing solely on binary-choice questions was implemented to simplify the extraction of a final stance during the unconstrained evaluation.\nFor the classification setting, we prompted the model using the prompt found in Appendix B.2, expecting a single-token output. In both the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) setting (Appendix B.3) and the unconstrained prompting setting (Appendix B.4), the model generated up to 1024 tokens. We then utilized GPT-4 to analyze and determine the stance of the model using the prompt in Appendix B.1. The first two authors manually evaluated a random sample of 50 CoT and 50 unconstrained generations to extract stances, achieving an accuracy of SET ACCURACY."}, {"title": "Prompts", "content": ""}, {"title": "Evaluation Prompt", "content": "You are tasked with classifying a response as one of the possible choices.

However, its application in the field of wastewater flow estimation remains underexplored due to: (1) a lack of available datasets, (2) inconvenient toolchains for on-device AI model development and deployment, and (3) hardware platforms designed for general DL purposes rather than being optimized for energy-efficient soft sensor applications. This study addresses these gaps by proposing an automated, end-to-end solution for wastewater flow estimation using a prototype IoT device.", "sections": [{"title": "I. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK", "content": "Combined sewer systems (CSS) are widely used worldwide but face increasing challenges from extreme weather exacer-bated by pollution and climate change. These conditions often lead to urban overflow events, significantly impacting public health and environmental sustainability [1]. Real-time control systems offer a promising alternative by preventing CSS over-flow through dynamic flow monitoring. However, these sys-tems are hindered by high operational costs and challenges in achieving continuous, accurate monitoring and real-time data processing [2]. Current flow monitoring techniques mainly rely on hydrological formulas, which, while cost-effective, lack the precision necessary for effective management. Advanced sensor technologies, such as Coriolis and Magnetic Induction devices, offer higher accuracy but are cost-prohibitive for widespread adoption in economically constrained regions [3]. Previous research has demonstrated the promising potential of soft sensors for flow estimation based on fluid level [1], [3]. Specifically, Noori et al. [3] simulated drilling conditions using a flow circulation system with a Venturi structure, utilizing three level sensors for input data, while a Coriolis mass flow meter provided target data. A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model was then used to efficiently estimate non-Newtonian fluid flow.\nBuilding on these datasets, our prior work [4] implemented a quantized MLP model on a low-power MCU (Cortex-MO RP2040) and an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S15) using TensorFlow Lite and our customized Elasti-CAI.Creator toolchains [5], respectively. The FPGA-deployed models demonstrated up to 28.44\u00d7 faster inference speed compared to MCU-deployed models, easily meeting real-time requirements. However, due to differences in applied quantization technologies, FPGA-deployed models exhibited lower precision. By applying integer-only quantization, we increased the model precision by up to 9.7% [6]. Additionally, implementing pipelined matrix multiplication on the FPGA reduced inference time by up to 9.39%, with an energy cost per inference only up to 5.71% higher.\nDespite these advancements, there remains a need for datasets specifically for wastewater flow estimation. Addi-tionally, the deployment of an integer-only quantized MLP model is not automated, making it challenging for researchers without FPGA expertise. Moreover, the previous hardware platform was overly powerful for this soft sensor application, leading to inefficient resource utilization and significant power consumption, resulting in energy inefficiency. This research explores end-to-end optimization strategies from sensor inte-gration to model deployment, as shown in Figure 11. The goal is to develop a scalable, efficient system capable of real-time, accurate wastewater flow measurement, thereby enhancing in-field monitoring capabilities in managing urban overflows."}, {"title": "II.

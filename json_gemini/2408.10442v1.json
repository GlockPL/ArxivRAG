Since, MCI has been linked to\nreduced social interactions and increased aimless movements, we aimed to automate the capture of\nthese behaviors to enhance longitudinal monitoring.\nMETHODS: Using a privacy-preserving distributed camera network, we collected movement and\nsocial interaction data from groups of individuals with MCI undergoing therapy within a 1700m\u00b2\nspace. We developed movement and social interaction features, which were then used to train a series\nof machine learning algorithms to distinguish between higher and lower cognitive functioning MCI\ngroups.\nRESULTS: A Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed statistically significant differences between high and\nlow-functioning cohorts in features such as linear path length, walking speed, change in direction\nwhile walking, entropy of velocity and direction change, and number of group formations in the\nindoor space.

Typically observed in individuals over the age of 65 [1], MCI is characterized by\nimpairment in memory, executive functions, attention, speed of processing, perceptual-motor abilities, and language [1],\nand often precedes dementia, with over half of those diagnosed with MCI progressing within five years [1]. U.S.\nprojections estimate 15 million people with Alzheimer's dementia or MCI by 2060, up from 6.08 million in 2017. [2].\nTimely MCI diagnosis allows patients and caregivers to gain insights and develop coping strategies while individuals\nstill possess the capacity to do so independently. However, diagnosis and treatment are often delayed due to limited\naccess to expert assessment or the dismissal of early symptoms as part of normal aging [3].\nMCI and its potential progression to dementia are linked to lack of physical exercise and infrequent mental or social\nstimulation [4, 5]. Considering that social relationships play a significant role in maintaining cognitive function during\naging [6, 7], the study of social interactions within the MCI population becomes paramount. Notable alterations in\nmotor and gait patterns, including aspects like balance and coordination [8], gait velocity reduction, increased stride\nvariability, and changes in stride time and length [9, 10, 11], are also evident. These behavioral markers hold promise in\nidentifying signs of cognitive decline in home or daily settings, potentially prompting individuals to seek professional\ndiagnosis and guidance.\nNumerous studies have explored the use of machine learning to analyze gait and spatial navigation for prescreening MCI.\nTypically, these studies involved dual-task assessments, where individuals performed a mental load task, such as simple\nmathematics, while walking. Gait features such as stride time, step time, single support time, swing time, double support\ntime, stance time, stride length, and step length have been utilized in conjunction with classification models like support\nvector machines to distinguish between MCI, dementia, and healthy populations [12, 13, 14]. However, the data for\nthese studies were collected in controlled environment, which may not generalize well to real-world scenarios. Several\nstudies have deployed motion sensors in the homes of elderly individuals living alone, equipping these residences with a\nrange of unobtrusive sensors, including motion detectors and environmental sensors [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 14]. These\nstudies utilized various features such as room activity distribution [15], an individual's ability to perform daily living\nactivities [16, 17], walking speed, overall activity levels within the home [18], and the time spent on different activities\nof daily living [19]. Due to the limitations of motion sensors, which can only detect the presence of individuals in a\nroom, these studies were confined to single-resident households. The sensors were limited in their ability to understand\nspatial usage and navigation behaviors, only capturing data at the room level without granular details on the motion\nor activity within the room, or interactions with other individuals. Social interactions in the MCI population remain\nrelatively understudied. Previous works have often relied on self-reports or caregiver accounts, which may introduce\nbias or overlook critical details due to the inherent limitations of recalling specific events.\nIn this feasibility study, we introduce a passive sensing pipeline designed to capture detailed movement (at a resolution\nof 1 to 2 meters) and social interaction cues during group activities in an MCI population. Comprising a distributed\ncamera network covering 1700m\u00b2, data were captured over fourteen months in an attempt to distinguish between groups\nof individuals with varying cognitive function levels. In particular, the individuals with MCI were active in a space in\nwhich there were also healthy individuals, mimicking a real-world situation involving caregivers and family."}, {"title": "2 Methods", "content": "We employed a distributed camera system to gather behavioral data from MCI cohorts.

Scores greater than or equal to 26 indicate normal cognition, 18 to 25 suggest mild cognitive\nimpairment, 10 to 17 imply moderate impairment, and less than 10 indicate severe impairment. Participants are allocated\nto a cohort with individuals of similar MoCA scores, thereby forming multiple cohorts representing high or low levels\nof cognitive functioning. We examined a total of 66 subjects with MoCA scores ranging from 10 to 29, divided into six\ncohorts (A-F) containing 11, 7, 12, 10, 13, and 13 subjects respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of MoCA\nscores within each cohort. Cohorts are categorized as either high functioning if the mean MoCA score exceeds 21 or\nlow functioning if the mean MoCA score is 21 or below. This threshold selection of 21 is based on its positioning\nmidway between the upper and lower limits of MoCA scores for MCI, namely 18 and 25.

The feature calculations were based on the tracked positions\nof individuals. From the individual trajectories from our multi-person tracking, the detection of a change in walking\ndirection was calculated by assessing the angle alteration between consecutive positions within the track. For instance,\nif we consider the consecutive three positions in a track denoted as \\(P\u2081 = (x\u2081, y\u2081), P\u2082 = (x\u2082, y\u2082), \\) and \\(P\u2083 = (x\u2083, y\u2083)\\),\nthe angle change, \u03b8, was computed by analyzing the line segments formed by \\(P_{1,2} = P\u2082 - P\u2081 \\) and \\(P_{3,2} = P\u2082 - P\u2083\\),\nwhere \\(\u03b8 = arccos(\\frac{P_{1,2} \\cdot P_{3,2}}{P_{1,2} \\cdot P_{3,2}})\\). We considered a 20\u00b0 change in walking direction to constitute a new linear path,\naccounting for the noise in position and body orientation estimation.

Specifically, the walking speed of lower-functioning groups was lower compared to higher-\nfunctioning groups, especially at higher speeds. This aligns with previous research that has found a decrease in\nwalking speed, particularly at higher speeds, to be associated with cognitive impairment [29, 30]. Furthermore, the\nmean linear path lengths were slightly longer in lower-functioning cohorts (\u2248 4.9m) compared to higher-functioning\ncohorts (\u2248 4.5m), suggesting that higher-functioning cohorts engaged in more directed and intentional movement.\nAdditionally, the velocity and orientation change entropies were greater in the lower-functioning cohorts, suggesting\nmore confusion during movement in these groups. Higher numbers of group formations were more commonly found in\nhigher-functioning cohorts than in lower-functioning cohorts. Notably, the feature \u201cLevy \u03bc parameter\u201d had p > 0.05,\nindicating comparable distributions across low and high-functioning cohorts. This observation may be attributed to the\ninclusion of individuals with normal cognition (such as care partners and therapeutic staff) alongside those with MCI in\nour cohort data. This mixed composition could have impacted the distributions of the Levy features, potentially diluting\ntheir discriminatory power. Most of these features, other than walking speed, have not been previously studied in detail\nand could potentially serve as new parameters to assess MCI.\nFigure 5 presents the feature importance obtained using the permutation feature importance method for the SVM for\nthree feature combinations: using all features (top), only social interaction features (middle), and only movement\nfeatures (bottom). These plots highlight the features that contributed most to the classification of high- and low-cognitive\nfunctioning cohorts by the SVM models, emphasizing the relative importance of each feature within the model. When\nusing all features (i.e., social interaction and movement features, Figure 5, top), the SVM model identified the most\nimportant features as mean and standard deviation of direction change, mean and standard deviation of velocity entropy,\nstandard deviation of walking speed, mean and standard deviation of location parameter of the Levy distribution, mean\nnumber of group formations in the activity area, kitchen, staff area and gym and the standard deviation of number\nof group formations in the lounge. The lounge, gym and activity areas are specifically designed to encourage social\ninteractions, providing open spaces and seating. It is interesting to observe that the Levy location parameters was among\nthe most important features when all features were used as well as when only movement features were used, contrary to\nWilcoxon rank sum analysis. We suspect that the Levy parameters provide useful signals when combined with other\nmovement features, such as walking speed and orientation changes, helping to find better classification margins for\nthe SVM. We also hypothesize that Levy parameters will provide useful information when the analysis is done on an\nindividual level, which is part of our future work. When only considering social interaction features (Figure 5, middle),\nthe most important features were the mean number of groups in the dining area and gym, and the standard deviation\nof the number of groups in the kitchen and gym. When only considering movement features (Figure 5, bottom), the\nmost useful features were mean linear path length, direction change, walking speed and scale parameter of the Levy\ndistribution and standard deviation of orientation change entropy and direction change. Previous studies have linked\naimless movements and frequent angle changes to MCI. Our findings, which show that the mean and standard deviation\nof direction change significantly contributed to classification when using only movement features and all features, are\nconsistent with these studies [14, 31, 27]."}, {"title": "5.3 Limitation & Future Direction", "content": "Our study uniquely focuses on group analysis of cohorts with varying cognitive impairment levels coexisting with\nhealthy individuals in a real-world setting.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Conducting effective user research is essential for developing user-centered designs and ensuring that products meet the needs and expectations of their target audiences [1]. Direct interview is a common method of collecting useful data for user experience (UX) and requirements engineering (RE) [2], [3]. UX interview, in particular, is a critical component of the research process, as it provides valuable insights into user behavior, pain points, and desires. However, researchers frequently encounter several issues that can affect the quality of insights gathered during user interviews and extend the duration of interview sessions [4]. Major issues include:\n\u2022 Loss of focus on key discussion topics: Interviewers can easily diverge from critical themes, leading to less relevant data collection [5].\n\u2022 Inefficient management of interview duration: Without proper tools, interviews can run longer than planned, causing participant fatigue and data quality degradation.\n\u2022 Prolonged and cumbersome post-interview analyses: Manual transcription and thematic analysis can be time consuming and error-prone, delaying actionable insights.\nTo address these persistent issues, we introduce Insight-Pulse, a cost-effective IoT-based system that combines hardware and software to enhance the UX interview process. By integrating an AI-based speech analysis, the system provides real-time support during interviews and automates the key aspects of user research. InsightPulse is currently a project under development that includes a hardware device and a web application. We develop a dedicated hardware device to ensure a distraction-free environment for interviewers and maintain focus without being interrupted by apps and notifications that commonly occur when using smartphones or tablets to record interviews. The current version of the InsightPulse hardware device features:\n\u2022 Real-time Summary: Automatically generates concise summary of the interview as it progresses and highlights the key points.\n\u2022 Proactive Follow-up Question Suggestions: Provides real-time suggestions with follow-up questions to help interviewers maintain focus.\n\u2022 Timer: Keeps track of the duration of the interview.\n\u2022 Database Storage: Stores interview conversation in text data and audio recording formats.\n\u2022 Interview Privacy Protection: Utilizes a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based device activation to provide a layer of privacy to the interview recordings. The RFID card serves as an access control mechanism to ensure that only authorized individuals can operate the device.\nThe associated InsightPulse web application offers additional post-interview analysis functionalities, featuring:\n\u2022 Interview Review and Extraction of Actionable Insights: Streamlines the process of reviewing interviews and extracting key insights.\n\u2022 Identification and Highlighting of Key Discussion Points: Ensures that critical themes are captured accurately and consistently throughout the interview.\n\u2022 Generation of Thematic Summaries: Provides immediate and structured insights to facilitate efficient data analysis.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II details the related work, Section III explains the methodology and hardware-software architecture, Section IV includes the cost and testing associated with InsightPulse, Section V out-"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "The development of InsightPulse is motivated by extensive research in the fields of Al-enabled UX research and explainable AI (XAI). This section reviews the related work that provided a foundation for understanding the technical and conceptual underpinnings of InsightPulse."}, {"title": "A. AI-Enabled User Experience Research", "content": "The integration of IoT and AI in UX research has been explored by several studies to deliver solutions with improved user experiences [6], [7]. In addition, the use of AI and machine learning capabilities for enhancing user experience is becoming a significant trend [8], [9], creating numerous new opportunities for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and UX professionals [10]. For instance, Yang et al. [11] propose a methodology for using AI technology to measure and enhance UX in mobile application design. It focuses on obtaining user behavior data from application logs and using deep neural networks to simulate user experience during app interactions. Kuang et al. [12] investigated the potential of proactive conversational assistants to aid UX professionals through automatic suggestions at three distinct times: before, in sync with, and after potential usability problems."}, {"title": "B. Explainable AI (XAI)", "content": "Explainable AI, or XAI refers to a set of techniques and methodologies to make the outputs of Al systems more understandable and interpretable by humans [18]. XAI is also a critical component in the development of AI-enabled UX tools. As outlined by Doshi-Velez and Kim [13], the need for transparency and interpretability in AI systems is paramount, especially in user research contexts."}, {"title": "C. Platforms", "content": "Several platforms have focused on developing user research by integrating AI-driven software for customer feedback analysis. Dovetail [14] is a platform designed to assist teams in the analysis, organization, collaboration, and storage of user research data and insights. It allows researchers to tag and annotate qualitative data, integrate quantitative insights, and generate detailed reports to aid decision-making processes. Another platform is Maze [15], which focuses on product discovery by transforming prototypes into actionable insights. Maze facilitates the validation of ideas, testing of user flows, and collection of early feedback, enabling teams to optimize designs based on real user interactions. Similarly, LookBack [16] offers capabilities for a quick and thorough review of conversations, thereby reducing the workload associated with sorting and summarizing interview data. It supports live interviewing, remote usability testing, and self-guided testing that features automatic transcription and session recording to streamline user research methodologies.\nHowever, the majority of the existing works have focused on developing software solutions that automate various aspects of the interview process, with an emphasis on post-interview analysis. These tools often aim to minimize or even replace the role of the human interviewer. In contrast, InsightPulse takes a different approach by integrating both hardware and software to enhance, rather than replace, the human interviewer. Unlike other systems, the InsightPulse hardware device provides real-time assistance during the interview, offering features such as automatic summaries and proactive follow-up question suggestions. This real-time support assists the interviewer to maintain focus and adapt to the conversation on the spot. In addition, the backend software system simplifies the post-interview analysis and research processes."}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "The architecture of InsightPulse integrates both hardware and software components to streamline the interview process through real-time support and automated data analysis. Fig. 1 illustrates the overall system architecture of InsightPulse. The system comprises a microphone and a microprocessor for capturing and converting speech to text, the OpenAI Application Programming Interface (API) for natural language processing and analysis, and a web application interface managed by Streamlit.\nThe data flow begins with the microphone capturing the interview speech, which is then processed by the microprocessor to convert the audio into text. This text data is subsequently sent to the OpenAI API for analysis, which generates two outputs: (i) Output 1: Real-time Summary, and (ii) Output 2: Follow-up Question Suggestions. The two output modes can be accessed by the interviewer with a single tap for the summary or a double tap for follow-up questions on the device, which is displayed on the device screen.\nThe raw text data is also stored in a database, which can be accessed via the web application for post-interview analysis. This analysis includes identifying key discussion points, analyzing keyword frequency, conducting sentiment analysis, and generating thematic summaries."}, {"title": "B. Hardware Design", "content": "To ensure the protection of user privacy during the interview process, the interviewer needs to use a dedicated RC522 RFID-based control card to turn the device on. Once powered on, the interview content is captured by the microphone, and the Raspberry Pi 5 microprocessor records and converts the audio data to text. The text data is sent to the OpenAI API for detailed analysis, where it undergoes some preset questions to generate a response. The interview text data and the OpenAI-generated response are stored in Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage. A 5-inch display shows key information in real-time during the interview. For example, when the interviewer taps the touch sensor once, the screen will display a key summary of the interview content so far, helping the interviewer understand the key insights up to that point. When the interviewer taps the touch sensor twice, the screen will display additional interview questions that can be further explored.\nTo make the device portable, we are currently using a rechargeable 5000 Milliampere-hour (mAh) lithium-ion battery to power the device. Fig. 2 illustrates the hardware setup of the InsightPulse device, and Fig. 3 shows an assembled device during a real-world UX interview assistance test."}, {"title": "C.

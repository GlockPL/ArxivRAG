{"title": "To Patch or Not to Patch: Motivations, Challenges, and Implications for Cybersecurity", "authors": ["Jason R.C. Nurse"], "abstract": "As technology has become more embedded into our society, the security of modern-day systems is paramount. One topic which is constantly under discussion is that of patching, or more specifically, the installation of updates that remediate security vulnerabilities in software or hardware systems. This continued deliberation is motivated by complexities involved with patching; in particular, the various incentives and disincentives for organizations and their cybersecurity teams when deciding whether to patch. In this paper, we take a fresh look at the question of patching and critically explore why organizations and IT/security teams choose to patch or decide against it (either explicitly or due to inaction). We tackle this question by aggregating and synthesizing prominent research and industry literature on the incentives and disincentives for patching, specifically considering the human aspects in the context of these motives. Through this research, this study identifies key motivators such as organizational needs, the IT/security team's relationship with vendors, and legal and regulatory requirements placed on the business and its staff. There are also numerous significant reasons discovered for why the decision is taken not to patch, including limited resources (e.g., person-power), challenges with manual patch management tasks, human error, bad patches, unreliable patch management tools, and the perception that related vulnerabilities would not be exploited. These disincentives, in combination with the motivators above, highlight the difficult balance that organizations and their security teams need to maintain on a daily basis. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications of these findings and important future considerations.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Cyber-attacks can originate from any location across the world and impact businesses, organizations, governments, and individuals.

First, there is the product vendor or developer; this group is responsible for creating the product and issuing updates as vulnerabilities are identified. Next is the group involved in identifying vulnerabilities, for instance, these may be sanctioned security researchers (e.g., internal to vendors, or those emerging through bug bounty or vulnerability disclosure programs) or malicious actors (e.g., nation states or cybercriminal gangs). Product owners, are the final primary group and are those who use a vendor's products and are responsible for implementing any patches issued. In an organization, this last group may be deconstructed even further to consider product owners and the employees who actually use the product; for example, an employee who uses cybersecurity software (e.g., a VPN) purchased by their organization (i.e., the product owner). Frei et al. provide a succinct overview of the interaction between these groups including the various possible pathways from vulnerability discovery to disclosure, patching and exploitation [27].\nA topic central to understanding why organizations - and particularly, their IT/security staff - apply or fail to apply patches is the patch management lifecycle itself. This involves identifying vulnerable technologies within the organization, deploying and installing the patches, and ongoing monitoring for patch compliance. While there are several ways to present this process, Dissanayake et al. [20] suitably contextualize it within the overall vulnerability and patch timeline. They define essential tasks for security and IT teams as patch information retrieval, vulnerability scanning, assessment and prioritization, patch testing, patch deployment, and post-deployment patch verification. Each of these activities is critical for organizations to perform and require IT and security staff to have a comprehensive inventory of their systems, tools to scan for the identified vulnerabilities, environments to test patches prior to deployment, and policies regarding deployment to production services and to engage in later patch verification. Moreover, these activities are time-critical given that the longer patches take to be implemented, the more time attackers have to exploit the related vulnerabilities."}, {"title": "3 The Incentives that Support the Decision to Patch", "content": "The question of why security/IT teams make the active decision to patch their organization's systems is a simple, yet complex one. To consider this, we first call attention to the different pertinent stakeholders involved: the organization itself (including IT/security teams), the vendors (inclusive of developers) that it purchases products from, the organization's business partners and clients, and the legal/regulatory jurisdictions that the enterprise operates in. Each of these can have an impact on decisions regarding patching.\nTo begin with the organization, patching as an activity is directly in the interest of the IT/security personnel and wider enterprise teams because it helps to secure the company against vulnerability exploits. A primary technique that threat actors use to compromise systems is unpatched vulnerabilities [44]; therefore, this acts to mitigate related attack vectors. Although cybersecurity may arguably still be intangible and a challenge for many organizations, the financial and reputational impacts/harms that would result from a successful breach [5,10,42], are salient. This may mean, for instance, that in the interest of self-preservation, concerns about finances or reputational damage can serve as key motivators for companies to addressing security concerns, such as patches. These factors can be central to any proposals that security teams may need to make to their business colleagues if there are internal deliberations about whether to apply a patch. In addition to the security it provides, related benefits to patching have also been cited in minimizing the organization's downtime in the medium-to-long term, under the assumption that falling victim to a cyber-attack will result in a longer period of unavailable services [20]. This, of course, is a delicate argument to make considering that patching itself also often requires downtime; however, the length of downtime and its predictability are likely to be better compared to a security breach. This is an argument that security professionals can use in engaging with their enterprise counterparts as part of a business case for patching for instance.\nFor IT/security staff, another enabler to the patching of systems is the availability of more efficient and effective processes and tools to allow it. Tools like automated patching [21], albeit not perfect, can significantly reduce many of the challenges to patching for security teams; in one study, 76% of organizations used some form of automated patching and 46% used live patching [61]. The wider roll out of these processes and tools may therefore assist IT/security personnel even further in addressing the patch management tasks at hand. Another benefit is that as a precursor to determining which systems are vulnerable, the tools need to find and scan all endpoints on a network. Prior to any patching therefore, this action can already help to detect endpoints and systems that administrators may have previously been unaware of. More generally, our also highlighted that automated patching, for instance, has been promoted due to its ability to allow organizations to better comply with data protection regulations [49].\nLegal and regulatory requirements, business partners, and clients are another significant incentive for patching. Over the last decade, governments have become more stringent regarding the security requirements placed on organizations as evidenced by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), NIS Directives, new US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cybersecurity rules, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and NCSC's Cyber Essentials. Many of these regulations and standards have provisions for maintaining the security of systems, which directly point to the need for timely patching. Undoubtedly, for many security teams especially those that work in heavily regulated sectors such as finance and healthcare, the directive to follow these regulations and standards will suffice. In other cases, however, businesses may ignore these either intentionally due to lack of resources, or unintentionally due to lack of awareness, until they have no other choice. For instance, it is noteworthy that despite its wide publicity and it being used as a pre-requisite to apply for some government contracts, the awareness of (and adherence to) the five-control Cyber Essentials scheme is still below 30% in 2024 in the UK [22].\nThere has also been an increase in international government-initiated efforts to notify organizations about key vulnerabilities and nudge them towards installing patches. One example is the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory in 2023 by the UK's NCSC, US' CISA and FBI, and Australia's ACSC on the top routinely exploited vulnerabilities [47]. This advisory complements existing national advisories and alerts issued by these national cybersecurity bodies separately. An noteworthy development pertaining to how governments engage regarding patches was the emergency directive by CISA on the 17 December 2021 ordering federal agencies to investigate and patch their systems against the Log4j vulnerability by the 23 December 2021 [14]. This directive speaks directly to those impacted and requires organizations and their IT/security teams to patch, and report on the update status to CISA (by the 28 December 2021).\nThe US' FTC also subsequently released a warning for organizations to address the vulnerability or face the consequences: \u201cThe FTC intends to use its full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take reasonable steps to protect consumer data from exposure as a result of Log4j, or similar known vulnerabil-"}, {"title": "4 What Motivates the Decision Not to Patch?", "content": "Patching by its nature is a challenging task which often involves a series of interdependent activities, complex networks, a range of applications, business processes and people. Yet, patching is critical to cybersecurity and failure to patch can result in breaches. The data breach of Equifax in 2017 which impacted 147 million individuals provides an poignant case study, which also highlights the human aspects involved [63]. In their case, organizational teams failed to define strategies for patch management, failed to act on vulnerabilities and install available patches, failed to define their assets (a prerequisite to understanding vulnerabilities that may be present), and failed to specify and follow a reliable process to gather vulnerability and patch information from product vendors - in this case, it relied on individual software developers. Such failings are, however, not new and arguably are as a result of the challenging nature of managing and deploying patches. Other more recent examples of organizations that have not patched and suffered breaches include the LastPass, Electoral Commission and the London Borough of Hackney [30,31,35].\nThere are at least five primary reasons why vulnerabilities are often not patched [46]. The first reason considers the resources needed to patch systems, e.g., the money, time and person-power required. For some IT/security teams, resources may not exist to support patch management, or their environments may be so complex that patch management is a minefield. If we consider micro businesses or Small-to-Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) as an example, their priorities are often elsewhere, and they are known to struggle with security generally even lacking dedicated IT/security teams [9,34]. Even if such organizations want to patch, they may not have the internal skills or expertise to test, implement and deploy it, or they may not be able to patch in a timely manner. A best-case scenario in this context is that internal teams work with managed (security) service provides or adopt software-as-a-service platforms; and that these providers then handle patching for the SME. This, however, is not always the case.\nFor larger organizations and IT/security teams who have the person-power, finances and time, the challenge instead is often on the alignment of these resources to identify, implement and follow-up patch management tasks in their extremely complex environments. Equifax is a relevant example of this where there were numerous mistakes and failures in the process, and there was little accountability demonstrated. Further evidence can be seen in the statement made by their Chief Information Officer who led the IT department during 2017, referring to patching as a \"lower level responsibility that was six levels down\" from him [63]. The size and complexity of the organization clearly impacted how significant issues such as patching were perceived. This resonates with existing studies which discovered that over 70% of security professionals found patching to be too complex and time consuming [33].\nAnother major challenge facing both small and large organizations and their IT/security teams is the volume of patches that need to constantly be applied and the question of what to patch first in such situations. These issues have been identified within the top four reasons why organizations delay patches [57]. While automated patching tools can help the process, they are not a panacea. A telling statistic from another industry study was that 72% of respondents did not apply patches because of the difficulty in prioritizing what needs to be patched [57]. While scoring systems such as CVSS exist and are used to prioritize vulnerabilities, the reality is that internal teams will will need to pair these with the impact on an organization's individual systems/assets to judge the risk exposure. This additional step can also prove difficult depending on the internal team's understanding of their own environment. A clear understanding of IT, security and business dependencies as well as close relationships between these teams is therefore also paramount.\nThe second reason relates to the challenge of knowing an organization's full portfolio of assets and their state. This links to the complexity of organizations and the reality that maintaining an up-to-date understanding of all assets on a corporate network is a significant undertaking for IT/security teams. Organizations can possess thousands of networked devices, systems and applications across IT, OT and IoT environments. Siloed systems and dynamic networks have also been recognized directly as key contributors to this complexity [29]. The widespread move to remote working due to COVID-19 travel and social restrictions has made these networks even more complicated, which has further exacerbated the scale of the patch management problem [33]. With these points in mind, it is unsurprising that cybersecurity schemes such as CIS's Critical Security Controls (CSC) spotlight 'Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets' and 'Inventory and Control of Software Assets' as the first two controls that are central to organizational security.\nThe third and fourth reasons acknowledge the risk that accompanies patching and the significant harm that may be caused if patches negatively impact existing systems and inadvertently cause business disruption. The reason why systems may be adversely impacted can vary and pertain to issues at the vendor (e.g., low quality or untested patch) or the IT/security product owner (e.g., failure to"}, {"title": "5 Discussion and Future Considerations", "content": "To maintain the security of organizations and systems, it is a critical activity for IT/security teams to install security updates. The incentives for patching are varied and include fulfilling legal and regulatory requirements or security-related requests from business partners, protecting the organization from security incidents, the availability of efficient and effective tools to support the patch management process for security teams, and a positive patching experience for IT/security personnel, especially as it relates to vendor engagement. Similarly, there are several reasons why organizations do not, or are disincentivized, to patch their systems. Our review detailed issues related to the nontrivial resources (e.g., person-power) needed to implement patches, the complexity of modern-day technology environments, the volume of patches to apply (and all of varied priority levels), the risk of inadvertent business interruption, and key human aspects factors such as reservations about tools meant to support patch management, the perception by companies (and evidence that suggests) that vulnerabilities are not often exploited, and potential questions about trust in vendors.\nComparing the incentives and disincentives there are compelling reasons on both sides. Legal and regulatory requirements are clearly one of the strongest ways to nudge organizations to install patches, and in a timely manner. If the regulation exists, then IT/security teams (driven by corporate guidance) will have to, in theory, find the resources to overcome issues of resourcing and complexity to implement the requisite patches. This may, however, be considered a more heavy-handed approach and governments may not want to take this route in a general case, but rather use actions such as mandates for extremely critical vulnerabilities, such as with the situation with Log4J and CISA. There is also the innate challenge with mandating any security controls or actions for all of a nation's organizations and how this would be actively promoted, checked and enforced. There have been interesting discussions for several years on the role of cyber insurance in security and whether this may be a route to incentivize better security practices; this, however, has yet to materialize [4,39]. Business partners are another strong avenue to incentivise patching if such partners are powerful enough to make demands of others in the supply chain, and if they fully appreciate the threat posed by unpatched partner systems themselves. The argument therefore is that if key supply chain organizations were successfully engaged, then they could place certain requirements related to patching into their service and security agreements with others in their chains.\nWhile there is clearly a strong argument that organizations interested in self-preservation will install patches (and that this itself, should suffice for motivation), this may be directly contested by concerns about the human resources (time, person-power, technical expertise) needed to implement patches, the complexity of enterprise environments (where patches are to be applied), the potential that patches may disrupt operations (even if it is linked solely to poor execution or human error), and the perception and reality that only a small number of vulnerabilities are actively exploited in the wild. Even in cases where installing patches from a vendor may be possible, mitigation approaches (e.g., virtual patching) may be pursued by (already overworked) security teams instead because they are less invasive. Addressing these concerns is difficult and requires efforts from organizations and vendors. One way forward may be improved tooling that is capable of more effective and efficient automation of patch management tasks. This could reduce the workload on IT/security teams, both in understanding the interdependence of affected systems and implementing required security updates. Automated tools- -even those built on generative AI systems and LLMs [6,37]-have already been highlighted as an enabler to patch management, but challenges also exist (e.g., conflicting reports, vendor stipulations) hence the need for improvements. These challenges make the role of security teams extremely difficult, and at a time where the industry is facing serious issues with respect to burnout [54].\nVendors also play a central role in either enabling or complicating the patch management activities in organizations. As identified from our review, a positive patching experience can have a notable impact on an IT/security (or business) team's desire (or support) to patch. This would therefore suggest that if ven-"}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "Motivating organizations and their IT/security teams to install security patches on their systems has been a problem for decades. As discussed in this article, there are various reasons for this reticence but also several factors that highlight the value of patching and that support the process. If the uptake of patching is to be increased, key incentive areas should be further emphasized. In particular, we would suggest enhancing tooling and automation leveraging generative AI platforms to support the work of cybersecurity staff, better support from and engagement with vendors, security nudges to organizations leveraged via trusted"}]}

{"title": "IMAS: A Comprehensive Agentic Approach to Rural Healthcare Delivery", "authors": ["Agasthya Gangavarapu", "Ananya Gangavarapu"], "abstract": "Since the onset of COVID-19, rural communities worldwide have faced significant challenges in accessing healthcare due to the migration of experienced medical professionals to urban centers. Semi-trained caregivers, such as Community Health Workers (CHWs) and Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs), have stepped in to fill this gap, but often lack formal training. This paper proposes an advanced agentic medical assistant system designed to improve healthcare delivery in rural areas by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic approaches. The system is composed of five crucial components: translation, medical complexity assessment, expert network integration, final medical advice generation, and response simplification. Our innovative framework ensures context-sensitive, adaptive, and reliable medical assistance, capable of clinical triaging, diagnostics, and identifying cases requiring specialist intervention. The system is designed to handle cultural nuances and varying literacy levels, providing clear and actionable medical advice in local languages. Evaluation results using the MedQA, PubMedQA, and JAMA datasets demonstrate that this integrated approach significantly enhances the effectiveness of rural healthcare workers, making healthcare more accessible and understandable for underserved populations.

Financial incentives have increasingly drawn qualified and experienced medical professionals to urban centers, leaving rural areas underserved. To address this gap, semi-trained caregivers, such as Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) in India [5], and Community Health Workers (CHWs) are stepping in to provide essential healthcare services. However, these caregivers often operate with limited or no formal training, which poses further challenges to the quality and effectiveness of healthcare in rural settings. Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic approaches, when applied to the healthcare domain, have the potential to be valuable tools in various healthcare areas. These technologies can provide contextual medical training, assist in diagnostics, and support the treatment of various simple to moderately complex clinical cases, particularly for CHWs and other healthcare workers in rural communities.\nTo make agentic medical assistants effective in rural parts of the world, these assistants should be context-sensitive, adaptive, and reliable. While foundational models such as GPT-4 and Llama 3 have been proven effective when evaluated using medical benchmarks like PubMedQA [6], their performance in multi-turn medical dialogs and medical decision-making is limited and requires significant engineering. Additionally, these assisting systems must be capable of clinical triaging and identifying complex cases that require specialist intervention and referral to a regional health center. Furthermore, the cultural nuances and limited literacy prevalent among rural health workers and patients make standard medical responses difficult to understand and act upon. For example, the"}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "LLMs are being increasingly customized for a range of applications within the healthcare and medical fields. These domain-adapted models are performing at human expert levels in tasks such as question answering, reading and generating medical reports, and clinical diagnosis. Most of these models are built predominantly using two approaches: 1) fine-tuning the foundational model with domain-specific datasets, and 2) using prompting and retriever systems. While these techniques have shown remarkable improvements in pretrained LLMs, they still perform unreliably in healthcare settings in rural areas.\nOur approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs in combination with multidisciplinary, contextual, and collaborative agents to enhance the performance and reliability of the healthcare system. While existing agent collaboration models incorporate techniques like role-playing, group discussions, and negotiation, I utilize the MDAgent framework[7], which dynamically selects the optimal collaboration strategy for execution."}, {"title": "3 IMAS: Integrated Medical Agent System", "content": "The Medical Assistant System (MAS) is designed to leverage best-of-breed architectural approaches to deliver context-sensitive medical advice in local languages. The key design principles are as follows:\n\u2022 Local Language Interaction: Rural healthcare workers, such as RMPs, can interact with the system in their local language and receive assistance in the same language.\n\u2022 Sensitivity to Local Context: The system should be sensitive to the local population's literacy levels and understanding to ensure they can act on the medical advice provided.\n\u2022 Guardrails for Misinformation: The system should include guardrails to prevent misinformation, disinformation, and toxic prompting.\n\u2022 Privacy and Security: The privacy and security of all participants, especially patients and health workers, should be protected while interacting with the system.\n\u2022 Accessibility: The system should be accessible on commonly used smart mobile devices.\nThe system consists of the following key components:\n\u2022 Medical Large Model: Llama 3 70B model fine-tuned with medical dialog datasets to enhance its performance in healthcare applications.\n\u2022 Translation Model: Meta's open-sourced Seamless-M4t-v2-large [10] is fine-tuned with local language and vernacular terminology.\n\u2022 Collection of Agents: These agents collectively evaluate the complexity of medical cases, perform diagnostic procedures adaptively, simplify medical responses for better understand-ing, orchestrate system interactions, and ensure responses are empathetic and patient-centric.\n\u2022 Integrated Guardrail System: To mitigate hallucinations and misinformation, the system incorporates an integrated guardrail framework using NeMo Guardrails [8]and Llama Guard[4], ensuring safer, more reliable interactions across medical applications."}, {"title": "3.1 Agents and Their Roles", "content": "Complexity Assessment Agent: This agent functions as a general practitioner (GP) who evaluates the complexity of each medical case presented.

They take the complex medical jargon and technical details provided by the diagnostic agents and translate them into clear, concise, and actionable information. Additionally, they incorporate important guardrails to ensure the accuracy and safety of the information provided. Their functions include:\n\u2022 Language Simplification: Breaking down complex medical terminology into simple language that can be easily understood by individuals with varying levels of literacy.\n\u2022 Cultural Adaptation: Tailoring the responses to be culturally relevant and sensitive to the local context, ensuring that the advice is not only understandable but also acceptable and actionable within the patient's cultural framework."}, {"title": "4 Results", "content": "To evaluate the IMAS, multiple benchmarks are being used. Traditional benchmarks such as MedQA and PubMedQA are employed alongside more specific datasets like guidelines. These datasets have been translated from various languages, primarily Chinese and English, into Telugu, Hindi, Swahili, and Arabic using Azure Cognitive Services.\nWith benchmarking datasets such as MedQA, PubMedQA [6], and JAMA [2], the emphasis is on evaluating models and agents in synthesizing various aspects of medical knowledge. Similarly, diagnostic tasks like DDXPlus [12] assess the ability of models to systematically analyze inputs and generate accurate diagnoses. The proposed framework demonstrated competitive performance, comparable to state-of-the-art models, when employing six specialized agents. However, reducing the number of agents to four, each focusing on different domains, resulted in a performance drop of over 10%. While replacing the fine-tuned custom Llama 3 70B model with GPT-4 led to an overall performance boost, results varied significantly across languages. Notably, Telugu and Hindi showed stronger performance compared to Arabic and Swahili. The overall system performance improved considerably when different models were assigned to different agents, particularly benefiting the Response Simplification Agent. Specific details regarding GPT-4's performance and the optimal number of agents in the framework still require further clarification."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "This project introduces an agent framework designed to enhance the application of LLMs as medical assistants for rural healthcare workers.

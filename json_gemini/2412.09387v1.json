Introduction", "content": "In recent decades, the growth of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, has increased the importance of proper maintenance and efficient operation of these technologies. Wind turbines, a pivotal component in wind energy generation, pose unique challenges due to their substantial size and intricate mechanical structures [1]. At the same time, they tend to take different forms of degradation over time, including blade cracks and mechanical failures, which can compromise performance or lead to complete shutdowns. Failure to detect such issues promptly can result in significant repair costs and loss of energy production [2, 3], emphasizing the critical need for continuous and reliable monitoring systems [4]."}, {"title": "2. Related works", "content": "Efforts to develop effective monitoring and inspection systems for wind turbines have intensified, focusing on early defect detection to mitigate unexpected failures and ensure continuous operation [12, 13]. Traditional methods, such as manual visual inspections [14] and ground-based equipment assessments [15], are increasingly considered inadequate due to inefficiency, high costs, and safety risks [16]. This has led to a growing interest in integrating advanced technologies like UAVs, sensor fusion, and deep learning (DL) [17] methods into inspection practices [18].\nSeveral studies have explored the use of UAVs for wind turbine inspections. Sanati et al. introduced an automated UAV-based system utilizing visual and thermal imaging to detect defects like blade cracks [19]. While this method enhanced detection capabilities, it was limited by its reliance on specific imaging modalities, potentially missing defects detectable by other sensors. Shihavuddin et al. employed UAVs equipped with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve surface defect detection [20]. Although this approach increased accuracy and explainability rates, it often depended on single-sensor data, which might not capture the full spectrum of potential defects.\nRecently, different research groups have investigated multi-sensor fusion techniques to overcome the limitations of single-sensor reliance.

Proposed architecture of intelligent systems", "content": "The task of collecting visual data on defects in green energy objects within a three-dimensional space necessitates the development of a comprehensive system that integrates various tools with different functional purposes. Given the specific nature of the objects under investigation, it is advisable to utilize and manage geographically distributed resources. Communication support is provided through appropriate information and communication technologies. A key element of the system should be the provision of automated management of all components, which is essential for the rational use of the system by end-users. Consequently, the challenge arises to design the intelligent system Ms to maximize the automation of data collection and analysis processes in real-time.\nThe components of the designed intelligent system Ms are presented in the general structural diagram and include various elements. The diversity of system components and their distribution significantly impact the system's operation. Therefore, the primary tasks in designing it should focus on ensuring the system's integrity during operation and achieving maximum resource efficiency.\nTo design the intelligent system Ms, it is necessary to first identify the objects it targets. Primarily, these are green energy objects, particularly wind turbines and their components. These objects are characterized by complex structures and large sizes, which require a special approach to the collection and processing of visual data.\nThe objects of study are located within a distributed three-dimensional space R3. To ensure precise collection of visual data for further analysis of detected defects across the entire area, the study region is defined as a set of spatial zones Zi, each including an individual wind turbine and its surroundings. For this purpose, we use the coordinates of the central points Ci (xi, yi, zi) of the turbines and the corresponding coverage radii Ri, which ensure full coverage of the entire structure.\nEach spatial zone Zi can be represented as a sphere with center Ci and radius Ri:\n$Z_{i} = {P \\in R^{3} | |P - C_{i}| \\leq R_{i}},$ (1)\nwhere |P - Ci| is the Euclidean distance between point P and the central point Ci.\nThe total coverage area A can be expressed as the union of all spatial zones:\n$A = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} Z_{i}$ (2)\nThe studied space A is defined as a set of spatial vectors Vi, and the vector V, which describes the coordinates of the central point and the coverage radius for each wind turbine in the designed system Ms, is represented as follows:\n$V_{i} = (C_{i} (x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i}), R_{i}), i = 1,2, ..., N,$ (3)\nwhere Ci (xi, yi, zi) are the coordinates of the central point of the i-th wind turbine, Ri is the coverage radius for this turbine, and N is the total number of turbines in the study area.\nThus, the area A can be represented as the set of all vectors Vi, which determine the coordinates and coverage radii: A = { Vi | i = 1,2, ..., N }. This set of vectors defines the complete study space in the designed system Ms. Therefore, we represent the spatial area in the form of a vector matrix:\n$\\begin{equation} M_{\\upsilon}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc} V_{1, x_{1}} & V_{2, x_{1}} & \\cdots & V_{N_{v}, x_{1}} \\\\ V_{1, v_{3,3}} & V_{N_{v}, v_{3,3}} & \\cdots & V_{N_{v}, v_{3,3}}\\end{array}\\right) \\tag{4} \\end{equation}$\nwhere (V1,x1 ... V1,03,3) are the 12 coordinates of the first vector (v\u2081) by formula (3).\nSimilarly, for the remaining (\u2081\u2081 \u2013 1) vectors. The values obtained from formula (4) are used as input data for the Ms system.\nThe system's component structure includes UAVs, mobile control devices, computing complexes, maintenance tools, and multifunctional sensors operating in an automated mode.\nThe diagram shown in Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of intelligent systems for collecting visual data and assessing the condition of defects in green energy objects, particularly wind turbines. The system consists of several levels and includes both hardware and software components that are integrated to ensure automated data collection, processing, and analysis.\nIn terms of functionality, each software and hardware component are defined at any given moment by its state, described by its functional capabilities [27]. Thus, the state of an individual component can be represented as a vector: Sf,s(t) = {Pf,s1(t), Pf,s2 (t), ..., Pf,snf,s(t)}, where Pf,s(t) represents the parameters of the system components at time t, defining their functional capabilities, and nfs is the number of such parameters. The set of all component states at a given time t forms the overall state of the system:\n$S(t) = \\bigcup_{f,s}S_{f.s}(t),$ (5)\nThe system components interact through specific connections, which can be represented using graphs. In this graph, vertices represent the system components, while edges denote the connections between them. The inter-component interactions are captured by the graph Gf,s, where f defines the functions representing the connections between components, and s indicates the states of these components. Thus, the system's graph is defined as follows:\n$G_{f,s} = (V, E), $ (6)\nwhere V denotes the set of vertices representing the system components, and E represents the set of edges that define the connections between these components.\nEach edge eij \u2208 E connects vertices vi and vj, corresponding to the interaction between components i and j. Each connection in the system can be described by a function that specifies how one component influences another. The set of all connections within the system is expressed as:\n$E = {e_{ij}(S_{i}, S_{j}) = f_{ij} (P_{ik} (t), P_{jl}(t)) | v_{i, j, k, l}},$ (7)\nwhere fij represents the functions that describe how the parameters of one component influence those of another.\nThus, the intelligent system Ms is characterized by its elements and the connections among them, defined as follows:\n$M_{s,z} = {S(t), E},$(8)\nwhere Ms,z represents the system Ms, including Z, which refers to its architectural task according to Figure 1.\nThe intelligent system Ms must provide the following functions:\nOrganizing the preparation and connection of UAVs to the system.\nCreating a three-dimensional software space A.\nDetermining the initial position of the hardware device relative to the object under study in space A.\nManaging the UAV's trajectory.\nSynchronizing and processing data in real time.\nIntegrating with other management and monitoring systems.\nDefining the states of the system and the object under study.\nThe objective of the system Ms, as outlined in formula (8), is to represent all elements of the system, along with the processes and interactions occurring among them. Since the heterogeneous components of the intelligent system Ms and the input data specified in formula (8) are not directly addressed, we define the system Ms as follows to account for these components:\n$M_{sz} = (K_{s,z,1}, K_{s,z,2}, ..., K_{s,z,n_{f,z}}),$ (9)\nwhere nfz is the number of sets indicating various system components by their characteristic features, and Ks,z,i is a set whose elements are homogeneous components that comprise the system Ms, with i = 1,2, ..., nfz . The designation Z in Ms, for system description refers to its architectural definition, which includes the physical components.\nThe final output of the Ms system is derived from the visual data gathered by external sensors and the intelligent processing applied to achieve the target task. According to formula (4), the operational three-dimensional space A consists of a set of vectors Vi, so the data collected by the external sensors is represented in matrix form as follows:\n$\\begin{equation} M_{J k}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc} d_{1,1} & d_{d,1} & \\cdots & d_{N_{d}, 1} \\\\ d_{1,n} & d_{n d, n} & \\cdots & d_{N_{d}, n}\\end{array}\\right) \\tag{10} \\end{equation}$\nwhere di,j denotes an element of the matrix MJk, representing a vector that contains information gathered by external sensors from the target areas within space (i, j).\nThe information, collected by external sensors and stored in matrix MJr, is processed within the corresponding hardware module, and the processing results contribute to the final outcome. To formalize this, we define a function Fjk, which, for each element of the matrix MJk (referenced in formula 10), generates the processed information from each target area. The target information is then computed as follows:\n$R_{jk} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{a}} \\sum_{j=1}^{d_{n}} F_{k} (d_{i,j}),$ (11)\nwhere Rjk is the target result of information processing, Na and dn are the number of target areas in the respective dimensions, and Fj (di,j) is the function that processes information from area (i, j).\nThus, the intelligent system Ms is comprehensively defined across all levels of its architecture, according to formulas (8) and (9). This definition is essential for detailing both the system's components and the interactions among its various modules. As outlined in formula (8), the Ms system operates as a distributed architecture, with modules integrated into software components"}, {"title": "4.

Conclusions", "content": "The proposed intelligent system architecture greatly enhances the dynamic collection and analysis of visual data for detecting defects in wind turbines. Experimental results from the \"Staryi Sambir-1\" wind power plant show that the system boosts defect detection accuracy to 90\u201394%, compared to 75\u201385% achieved with traditional manual inspections. The inspection time per WEU is reduced from approximately 6 hours to as little as 1.5 hours, with coverage completeness increasing to 90\u201395%. Additionally, the system enables faster criticality assessments, cutting evaluation time from up to 1.5 hours to just 0.1-0.2 hours.\nDespite these advancements, the proposed approach has limitations, such as the initial costs of deploying UAVs and sensors, the need for sophisticated algorithms to manage multi-sensor data fusion, and potential challenges in coordinating UAVs under adverse weather conditions. Moreover, reliance on high-quality data processing infrastructure may pose accessibility challenges in remote locations.\nFuture research will focus on mitigating these limitations by optimizing the system's cost-effectiveness, enhancing algorithmic performance under diverse environmental conditions, and refining UAV coordination mechanisms."}]}

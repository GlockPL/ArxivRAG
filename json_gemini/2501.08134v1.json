Venner", "Leandro D. de Santana", "Esteban Ferrer"], "abstract": "Fast-turn around methods to predict airfoil trailing-edge noise are crucial for incorporating noise limitations into design optimization loops of several applications. Among these aeroacoustic predictive models, Amiet's theory offers the best balance between accuracy and simplicity. The accuracy of the model relies heavily on precise wall-pressure spectrum predictions, which are often based on single-equation formulations with adjustable parameters. These parameters are calibrated for particular airfoils and flow conditions and consequently tend to fail when applied outside their calibration range. This paper introduces a new wall-pressure spectrum empirical model designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of current state-of-the-art predictions while widening the range of applicability of the model to different airfoils and flow conditions. The model is developed using AI-based symbolic regression via a genetic-algorithm-based approach, and applied to a dataset of wall-pressure fluctuations measured on NACA 0008 and NACA 63018 airfoils at multiple angles of attack and inflow velocities, covering turbulent boundary layers with both adverse and favorable pressure gradients. Validation against experimental data (outside the training dataset) demonstrates the robustness of the model compared to well-accepted semi-empirical models. Finally, the model is integrated with Amiet's theory to predict the aeroacoustic noise of a full-scale wind turbine, showing good agreement with experimental measurements.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Rotating blades found in wind turbines or propellers generate noise that can cause health and physiological problems in humans in close proximity. More generally, anthropogenic noise can have a non-negligible impact in animals, disrupting essential activities such as communication, reproduction, or predator avoidance [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore, noise regulations have arisen in several fields [5, 6, 7, 8] to limit noise generation and reduce the impact on the environment. Modeling and predicting the noise produced by an airfoil with fast turn-around methods is crucial to incorporate noise limits in the design phase of new rotating blades.\nFlow-induced noise is the most important noise source in several applications such as wind turbines, aircraft, and ships. Trailing-edge noise, also known as airfoil self-noise, is the minimum amount of noise that an aerodynamic surface can produce [9]. It is caused by the interaction of the turbulent boundary layer with the airfoil finite trailing edge. The convecting turbulence within the boundary layer causes wall-pressure fluctuations. Close to the trailing edge, these fluctuations are scattered to the far field as noise due to the sudden change of impedance at the trailing-edge discontinuity. Indeed, there is a high correlation between the wall pressure fluctuations spectrum (WPS) close to the trailing edge and the far-field noise spectrum. Consequently, semianalytical noise prediction methods are often based on the wall-pressure spectra. This is the case of Amiet's theory [10]. Measurements of wall pressure fluctuations close to the trailing edge during experiments is extremely challenging due to the thin trailing edge thickness of wind tunnel models. Numerical simulations are also challenging when trying to resolve turbulent structures near the airfoil walls, resulting in expensive simulations that cannot be used during design optimization procedures. Therefore, finding an accurate and general model for the turbulent boundary layer WPS is fundamental for the accurate and rapid assessment of trailing-edge noise.\nThe WPS beneath a turbulent boundary layer has a broadband nature and contains information on the flow structures across the boundary layer of both the inner and the outer regions [11]. The low-frequency range is caused by the large structures present in the outer part of the boundary layer and therefore scales with the boundary layer thickness (\u03b4) and the edge velocity (Ue) [11]. The smaller turbulent structures, located close to the wall, are"}, {"title": "2. Methodology", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1. Wall-pressure spectrum definition", "content": "The WPS (\u03a6pp) is divided into three frequency bands: low-frequency, mid-frequency, and high-frequency, that is, \u0424pp/LF, \u0424pp|MF, and Opp|HF, respectively, which are delimited by f2 and f3, as shown in Fig. 1. f2 limits the low- and mid-frequency bands, and is defined as the frequency of the maximum spectral level along the entire frequency range. f3 limits the mid- and high-frequency ranges. f3 is defined as the frequency where the decay of the WPS level as a function of frequency changes significantly, suggesting that a different physical phenomenon dominates the WPS.\nTo obtain f3, the experimental spectrum was divided into frequency bins of 500 Hz; the center of the bin was progressively moved by 240 Hz. The spectrum slope for each bin was calculated by fitting a first-order polynomial to the logarithmic values of the spectral level and the frequency. f3 is considered where the slope deviates by more than 5% from the value of the previous bin. f1 and f4 define the frequency range in which the WPS is calculated. Those frequencies do not affect the model itself but are needed to blend the curves of each frequency bands into a single curve. f1 is defined as 0.5f2 and f4 is defined as the highest frequency limit where the WPS is calculate."}, {"title": "2.2. Symbolic regression approach", "content": "Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged in recent years as an alternative to traditional regression algorithms to derive models from data (fitting data).\nWhile the traditional approach is based on a user-defined function, with some tunable coefficients that can be adjusted to minimize the error between the function and the data, the SR approach allows us to discover new functions from scratch. The main idea is to provide mathematical operators to the algorithm that can be combined automatically to define the best equation to fit the data. This way of solving problems involves a change in the current paradigm and provides an alternative to rediscover formulations of physical laws [28], among other applications. A main advantage of SR is that it does not require a priori specification of the model, and hence it is not affected by human bias or unknown gaps in domain knowledge. Although this family of algorithms was developed in the early 1990s, recent advancements in machine learning and the rapid improvement of computing power have fostered the use of SR for different fields; such as wind turbine wake modeling [29], astrophysics [28], turbulence [30], discovery of missing terms in differential equations [31], material science [32] and prediction of solar power production [33], among others. The application of SR in the field of acoustics is scarce, but some advances have been made in the prediction of sound propagation in shallow water environments [34] and in the modeling of noise generation for porous airfoils [35]. Although some attempts have been made in the reconstruction of the WPS model through symbolic regression [36, 26] and neural networks (NN) [22], these models are difficult to generalize (for SR-based approaches) and lack interpretability (in the case of using NN).\nIn this work, SR is used to discover mathematical expressions to model the turbulent boundary layer WPS of two airfoils. The algorithm training is performed on the basis of experimental data (detailed in the following sections). Furthermore, the set of allowed variables are inflow conditions and boundary layer parameters that can be easily defined/obtained, allowing for a generalizable approach.\nSymbolic regression algorithms are based on the main idea of continuously constructing new analytical functions, constrained by the user's input, to fit a set of data. These functions are created by using a set of operators (e.g., +, -, *, /,...), functions (e.g., abs(), sin(), log(),...) and variables (e.g., x, t,...) that the user must decide beforehand. The resulting solution is formed by a combination of these operators and variables in a specific order. Another key aspect of SR is the complexity of the solution. If no constraints were applied to limit the complexity, very long equations with poor interpretability could be created. Therefore, the complexity of the final solution is usually constrained by defining the maximum length of the new functions."}, {"title": "2.3.

The statistical similarity of the measurements of the twelve microphones was compared. The WPS matched within 2 dB for all the microphones.\nRemote microphone probes consist of pinholes of 0.3 mm diameter on the airfoil surface connected to a unique stainless steel tube of 1.6 mm inner diameter. A tube assembly outside the model connects the tubes to the microphones and the anechoic termination, i.e., a plastic tube of 1.6 mm inner diameter and 3 m long. The extreme of the anechoic termination was sealed to avoid airflow passing through the tube because of the difference in pressure between the airfoil surface and the environment. On the side of the tube assembly, Knowles FG 23329-P07 microphones are connected. The junctions of the stainless steel tube, the anechoic termination, and the microphones with the tube assembly were sealed to prevent leakage, which was verified during the calibration of each RMP.

Conclusions", "content": "This paper presents a new semiempirical model for predicting the WPS of turbulent boundary layers of mid- to high-Reynolds numbers under both adverse and favorable pressure gradients. The model is derived from experimental measurements of wall-pressure fluctuations on the suction and pressure sides of two airfoils across a wide range of inflow velocities and angles of attack. Unlike conventional single-equation models, the proposed model divides the WPS into three frequency bands, accounting for the physics of the turbulent scales that contribute to wall pressure fluctuations in different frequency ranges. Symbolic regression is used to derive mathematical expressions for each frequency range, using boundary layer parameters that can be obtained from simple tools such as XFOIL (or CFD simulations), thus preserving the simplicity and efficiency of single-equation models. The resulting model consists of five equations: three for the WPS levels in each frequency range and two for the boundary frequencies.\nWithin the training dataset, the model predicts the wall-pressure spectrum with a maximum integrated error of 23 dB, which is a difference in the spectral level of 4 dB.\nThe model is validated against experimental data from the ldifference of maximum 4 d of the wall-pressure spectrum level between the measured and predicted data. iterature that encompass various airfoils, Reynolds numbers, and angles of attack. The results demonstrate the good performance of the model under a variety of conditions. Slight reduction in accuracy is observed for strong adverse pressure gradients (pre-stall angles of attack) and is attributed to XFOIL predictions at high angles of attack. Overall, the model exhibits greater robustness compared to widely used semi-empirical and empirical alternatives, since it has the lowest maximum and average error and the lowest standard deviation for the validation cases. The standard deviation of our model is 10.2, compared to 46.1, 68.5, and 105.5 observed for other semiempirical methods.\nFinally, the model is challenged to predict full-scale wind turbine trailing-edge noise, achieving good agreement (within less than 1 dB) with field measurements."}, {"title": "Appendix A.

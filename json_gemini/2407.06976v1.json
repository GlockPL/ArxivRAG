Achieving this goal requires, as a first step, the development of a metadata model that, on the one hand, complies with existing standards, on the other hand, allows interoperability with other systems, and on the third, captures all the elements of description established by the curators of the collections. In this paper, we present a report on the current status of the work, in which we outline the most important requirements for the data model under development and then make a detailed comparison with the two standards that are the most relevant from the point of view of collections: Europeana Data Model used in Europeana and Encoded Archival Description used in Kalliope.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The history of libraries organizing (meta)data about their items is\u2014perhaps\u2014as old as the concept of libraries. The appearance of different media for the storage and transfer of human knowledge is correlated with the evolution of techniques and artifacts for encoding library metadata. A significant recent iteration of such an interplay is visible with the advent of information and communications technology and the accompanying attempt to implement cataloging techniques that draw upon the potentialities of such systems. Linked Data (LD) is the technology that embodies the current trends in metadata organization [2]. Linked Data is essential for the Semantic Web paradigm.\nLD is based on the endeavor to represent data using shared vocabularies for both individuals, their characteristics, and the relation between individuals. Such a metadata vocabulary references unique web identifiers (URI) in a machine-readable way that allows linkage to semantically related resources from other datasets. Modeling a certain dataset using linked data facilitates data integration between institutions and certain operations with the dataset, including knowledge discovery, enrichment, and visualization. The basic standards for such data models are RDF, OWL, SKOS, and SWRL [4].\nThere are two main reasons for libraries' move towards linked data technologies. First, library resources are usually of different kinds, such as books, manuscripts, journals, drawings, etc. The meaning of such artifacts is intrinsically connected to the spatial and temporal contexts in which they are inserted, as well as other individuals to which they are linked, including author information, and other referred publications. Second, there is a trend of making institutional resources available and accessible for expanded collaboration possibilities. The advantages of linked data can be levered proportionally to the richness and interoperability of a given resource's metadata.\nCommitment of Jagiellonian University (JU) and especially Jagiellonian Library (JL) to linked data is visible from its integration with the Europeana portal (https://europeana.eu/). Europeana-Europe's digital cultural heritage platform integrating more than 3000 institutions already offers access to more than 600.000 documents from the JL. The search and access of such documents depends on the metadata provided by the partner institution. Among the metadata elements currently provided by the JL, there is information about the type of item, subject, creation date, and language of the document.\nOn the one hand, the current metadata integrated into the Europeana portal can provide a powerful representation of the given document. On the other hand, there is a set of elements that, if present, would significantly enrich the given representation, and thus enhance the advantages of linked data. Such enrichment possibilities are especially present in the case of subtypes of manuscripts, e.g., in letters with information about the sender and receiver, or in historical documents with descriptive information about their history (Regest).\nGiven the prospects of a richer representation of manuscript metadata, the Jagiellonian Library supports the development of a standard for such a task. The main pillars of this endeavor are the inclusion of the detailed description format developed at the JL, the preservation of the possibility of integrating with Europeana, and the ability to integrate with the Kalliope system (catalog managed by German libraries). This paper describes the work in progress towards developing such a standard. In Sect. 2, we present the description format developed at JL (The Knowledge Matrix), and two related data models: Europeana's EDM and Kalliope's EAD. Sect. 3 then compares them, highlighting their points of compatibility and incompatibility. Sect. 4 concludes the paper."}, {"title": "2 Metadata schemes", "content": null}, {"title": "2.1 The Knowledge Matrix (TKM)", "content": "As part of the ongoing DiHeLib and CHEXRISH projects, three Jagiellonian University units namely the Jagiellonian University Museum, the Jagiellonian University Archives and the Jagiellonian Library\u2014are digitizing, describing, and interlinking collections of manuscripts from the Sammlung Autographa collection from the so-called Berlin Collection [9] (DiHeLib project) and collections of archival documents related to the university's history (CHExRISH project). In the course of this work, the librarians and curators of the collections prepared a new standard for the description of historical documents, for which a set of Microsoft 365 cloud-based tools was then developed (for a detailed description of the entire workflow and toolset, see [6]), in particular Microsoft Excel spreadsheets serving as data entry interfaces, which were named The Knowledge Matrix (TKM). The core elements of this description schema with actual values for sample document can be found in Tab. 1."}, {"title": "2.2 Europeana Data Model (EDM)", "content": "With the goal of offering interoperability and accessibility of data on a massive scale, Europeana developed a schema for structuring data called the Europeana Data Model (EDM). One of the tenets of EDM is being \u201can open, cross-domain Semantic Web-based framework that can accommodate the range and richness of particular community standards such as LIDO for museums, EAD for archives or METS for digital libraries\" [5]. At the same time that EDM offers a certain structure for representing metadata, it also allows for enrichment given third-party sources. EDM is based on the principles of linked data and is built around a knowledge graph.\nThree fundamental distinctive classes in EDM are the provided cultural heritage object (represented as edm: ProvidedCHO), the digital representation of the object (edm: WebResource), and the aggregation as a representation of the link between the former and the latter (ore: Aggregation). An example of an EDM representation of the Mona Lisa painting is present in Fig. 1.\nThere are 35 core properties for edm: ProvidedCHO, they are divided into mandatory, recommended, and optional properties. One way to guide a providing institution on the adequate subset of properties to take into consideration while developing a representation for a document's metadata is the A-C tier requirements. Fulfilling Tier A requirements is equivalent to treating the Europeana website as a basic search platform, while Tier B integration amounts to using Europeana as an exploration platform. Finally, achieving Tier C is equal to treating Europeana as a knowledge platform. The project reported in this paper aims to achieve Tier C integration with Europeana.\nThere are three categories of requirements for reaching a given tier: language, enabling elements, and contextual classes. Language refers to the presence of language tags in metadata elements that have text string values. Enabling elements are metadata elements about the document that help its search and fit in one of the following \"Discovery Scenarios\": browse by date or time span, by subjects and types, by agents or by place. Finally, contextual classes such as edm: Agent, skos: Concept, edm: Place, edm: TimeSpan-give context to the provided cultural heritage objects aiding their retrieval. The relation between different tiers and the requirements can be accessed in [1].\nIn the comparison table (see Tab. 2), we take into account the mandatory and recommended properties and the tier classification. The comparison table presents a comprehensive (but not exhaustive) list of EDM properties that are significant for manuscripts and that meet the requirements for Tier C."}, {"title": "2.3 Kalliope (EAD)", "content": "Kalliope (https://kalliope-verbund.info/en/) is an online catalog for personal papers, manuscripts, and publishers' archives. Kalliope was originally founded by the Berlin State Library, but has grown to integrate metadata from institutions all around the German-speaking countries, including German language archives in other countries, such as Poland or the United States. Standardized data from partner institutions can be made available for retrieval in Kalliope, given compliance with the Encoded Archival Description (EAD) format.\nThe EAD is an international XML-based standard for the description and exchange of archival data. EAD possesses a hierarchical structure and makes it possible to describe the relation between wholes and parts in a collection\u00b9.\nEAD contains elements for persons, families, places and corporate bodies; these elements allow references to unique identifiers for such individuals. Kalliope utilizes links to the Integrated Authority File (Gemeinsame Normdatei, GND) of the German National Library to identify individuals.\nOne of the main differences between EDM and EAD is that EDM is structured as a knowledge graph, while EAD is based on XML tags. The former represents the aggregation of a certain digital version of an object, focusing on the graph of characteristics of the physical object. The latter is a representation of a finding aid document hierarchically related to a collection and the present items. The primary goal of a finding aid is to provide information about the history of a collection and how the materials within it are organized, helping users navigate the collection and locate relevant material for their research [7]."}, {"title": "3 Comparison of metadata schemes", "content": "Despite the differences between EAD and EDM, propositions exist on how to map elements from one standard to the other. Hennnicke et al. [3], for example, demonstrate how an archival finding aid encoded in EAD-XML format can be represented using an RDF-based model such as EDM. Furthermore, the extensive report by Rockenbauer et al. [8] summarizes the requirements and procedures for mapping mandatory EDM fields with the EAD standard. Drawing on the advancements presented by such works, Tab. 2 compares TKM, EDM, and Kalliope's EAD as a guideline for the development of a standard for representing manuscripts' metadata by the JL."}, {"title": "4 Conclusion and further works", "content": "In this work, we compared the Kalliope's EAD and the Europeana's EDM standard to extract a list of concepts for a manuscript metadata standard that can be interoperable with these platforms and that can advance the goal of metadata enrichment and availability at Jagiellonian University. The work-in-progress character of this study allows for highlighting and applying necessary changes in the standard under development. Two important aspects are delineating uniquely identifiable sub-properties for interaction between people and manuscripts and for the material state of the manuscript.\nBesides these mentioned future modifications, there are other pressing issues for future research on developing a manuscript standard and taking advantage of manuscript metadata as linked data. One of the threads for future research is the representation of dates. The specification of dates in manuscripts is not always precise, or certain, or can involve timespans of different magnitude. These difficulties call for the development of best practice guidelines for dealing with temporal information. Another thread is the development of a recommendation system for manuscripts, drawing on a prospective knowledge graph including linked manuscript metadata. The next step in the solution to these challenges is the development of an ontology to formalize the concepts present in the comparison table."}]}

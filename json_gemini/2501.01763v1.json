Introduction", "content": "The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 catalyzed a global surge in corporate investment and public interest in artificial intelligence (AI). Companies across various sectors significantly increased their investments in AI technologies; however, some have exaggerated their involvement, leading to regulatory scrutiny. For instance, the SEC charged two investment advisers for making misleading AI-related disclosures, a practice termed \"AI washing\" (SEC, 2024). Concurrently, there has been a proliferation of AI-related Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), raising questions about the expertise of asset managers in the complex domain of AI technologies. We find that the composition of these AI ETFs often reflects subjective decision-making rather than a reliance on robust, objective, quantifiable metrics. This raises a critical inquiry: How equipped are traditional asset managers- individuals who may not necessarily have a background in technology-to assess the AI-relatedness of a company accurately?\nDefining what constitutes an \"AI stock\" or an \"AI-themed\" investment is a complex challenge that lies at the heart of this research. We aim to develop a scholarly framework to understand and categorize such investments by first clarifying Al's role within the investment arena: Is AI utilized as a tool for investment management, or do the investments represent stakes in AI technology companies? In this study, we concentrate on stocks and indices that provide investors with opportunities to engage with and profit from AI technology itself. This focus raises a pivotal question: How can a stock or index be accurately identified as AI-centric? For example, consider Nvidia\u2014a company crucial to the AI industry due to its production of chips essential for AI computing. Yet, Nvidia's influence extends beyond AI, impacting industries such as gaming and cryptocurrency mining. This underscores a fundamental insight: stocks or indices are rarely exclusively tied to a single technology like AI. Instead, they are often strategically positioned to maximize Al exposure while acknowledging their multi- sectoral influence.\nA preliminary examination of thematic indices focused on Al reveals that the selection criteria for investments are often opaque, relying on vague phrases such as \"companies that potentially stand to benefit from increased adoption and utilization of [...] artificial intelligence\" (Global X, 2023a) or \u201ccompanies that could benefit from the long-term growth and innovation in [...] artificial intelligence\" (iShares, 2023). These subjective statements hinder the development of a clear, general concept of \"AI stocks.\" To address the challenge of objectively identifying AI-centric investments, our study develops a data-driven methodology for classifying AI stocks based on publicly available corporate disclosures. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze annual 10-K filings from 3,395 NASDAQ-listed firms spanning 2010 to 2022, aiming to quantify each company's engagement with AI technologies. Our approach involves creating both a binary indicator of AI mention and a weighted AI score that reflects the frequency of AI-related terms in these disclosures. Specifically, our methodology"}, {"title": "2.2. The ChatGPT Effect", "content": "Since the debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, which quickly became the fastest-growing consumer application on record (Hu, 2023), the debate about the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has gained significant traction across various sectors, particularly in financial markets. The breakthrough of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a global conversation regarding AI's purported potential (Bhaimiya, 2023; Murphy Kelly, 2023), resulting in a spillover effect that has elevated both the perceived potential and profitability of AI-centered investments.\nThe growing global focus on AI and its capabilities has significantly influenced investor behavior, as evidenced by notable stock performance in the sector. For instance, Nvidia's stock value more than quadrupled (Bowman, 2024), and AI-specialized firm c3.ai saw its stock rise by 28% following the incorporation of ChatGPT into its AI toolset (Fox, 2023). Even Buzzfeed, a digital media company not primarily associated with AI, experienced a 120% surge in its share price following the announcement of adopting OpenAI's technology for content creation (Diaz and Smith, 2023). These examples reflect a broader market trend where companies benefit from their association with AI, regardless of their direct involvement with ChatGPT or LLMs. Further illustrating this trend, companies like BigBear.ai and SoundHound AI saw significant stock gains following the launch of ChatGPT (Singh and Biwas, 2023), highlighting increased investor confidence in AI-focused businesses. However, this surge in AI-related investments has also led to regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, research on crypto assets has shown that AI-centric assets have experienced significant abnormal positive price movements due to the heightened perception and valuation of Al's potential post-ChatGPT (Ante and Demir, 2024; Saggu and Ante, 2023). This spillover effect underscores the profound impact of AI advancements on stock market dynamics and investor sentiment.\nInvestor enthusiasm for Al predates the era of ChatGPT. Research has shown that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with \u201cAI\u201d in their names were valued approximately 0.4% higher than comparable ETFs without the term AI, highlighting an AI name premium (Wu and Chen, 2022). Recent advancements in LLMs have extended this early recognition of Al's (perceived) economic significance. It is important to acknowledge that LLMs and the broader field of generative AI\u2014which, e.g., includes the creation of pictures, music, or videos\u2014represent just one application area of AI that has captured significant public interest. Nevertheless, the success of generative Al does not detract from Al's potential in other domains. In fact, the achievements in generative AI likely contribute to a spillover effect, enhancing the perceived overall potential of AI across different sectors.\nGiven the rising influence of AI in financial markets, corporate disclosures of AI will likely become critical in shaping investor perceptions and decision-making. The substantial stock performance boosts observed following AI-related announcements underscore the market's demand for transparent and reliable Al reporting\u2014also to prevent \"AI washing\" (SEC, 2024). As companies increasingly integrate"}, {"title": "2.3. Technology and AI in Public Disclosures", "content": "Corporate filings, particularly 10-K reports, have long been a key source for extracting firm-level insights, with recent analyses focusing on technology-related disclosures due to their potential impact on stock performance. For example, Andreou et al. (2020) employed textual analysis to formulate a measure of market orientation and uncover a positive correlation with firm performance. Research has identified that technology-specific announcements, including those on blockchain and the metaverse, often prompt positive market reactions, underscoring investor receptiveness to technological advancements as indicators of future growth potential(Aharon et al., 2022; Cahill et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2019).\nIn parallel, the recent literature has focused on the analysis of sustainability-related topics, notably corporate social responsibility (CSR) (Cannon et al., 2020) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues (Jiang et al., 2023). For instance, Baier et al. (2020) highlighted that an average of 4% of all words in 10-K reports pertained to ESG, signifying the growing importance of these issues in corporate disclosure and communication, a sentiment echoed by Heichl and Hirsch (2023). The tone used in communicating ESG matters within 10-K filings has been linked to stock market performance around the filing dates (Ignatov, 2023). This underscores the significance not just of the content but also of the manner in which it is conveyed, reinforcing the idea that the qualitative aspects of corporate communications are pivotal in shaping market reactions.\nAmid these disclosure trends, AI-related information has emerged as a new focal point, yet research in this area remains limited. Mishra et al. (2022) found that AI usage in firms, as identified through textual analysis, correlates with higher profitability and efficiency. On the other hand, Wang and Yen (2023) discovered that firms disclosing AI involvement tend to have higher stock prices, and AI-related risk disclosures are viewed positively by investors. While both studies have clear relevance to this study, they pursue significantly different objectives."}, {"title": "2.4. Thematic Investing and ETFs", "content": "As investors increasingly seek exposure to companies actively engaged in transformative technologies like AI or in adhering to ESG standards, thematic investing has gained popularity as a strategy to target long-term trends that influence the global economy. This investment approach centers on capitalizing on emerging areas such as technological innovation, demographic shifts, and environmental changes (Claus and Krippner, 2018), thus aligning with the growing emphasis on thematic corporate disclosures explored above. The growing popularity of thematic investment strategies reflects investors' growing interest in high-growth areas and innovative industries, as thematic investing aligns portfolios with these dynamic shifts (Somefun et al., 2023). sectors positioned to benefit from these overarching trends, thematic investing represents a forward-looking approach that increasingly relies on corporate disclosures of sector-specific engagement, like technology adoption or sustainability practices (Dheeriya and Malladi, 2019; Methling and von Nitzsch, 2020, 2019).\nThematic ETFs, including those focused on technology, AI, or ESG, serve as prime examples for thematic investing by giving investors direct access to specific market segments without the need to handpick individual stocks. Technology ETFs, for example, include investments ranging from established technology companies to emerging fields like AI, robotics, and biotech (Wu and Chen, 2022). These ETFs align with thematic investment goals by focusing on sectors expected to drive economic growth and innovation, providing investors with a diversified entry point into the companies leading these trends. Thematic ETFs promise to simplify access to specific market segments by offering targeted exposure without the need for investors to handpick individual stocks. This feature is especially appealing to investors who want exposure to trends but lack the resources or expertise to identify or analyze individual companies engaged in these areas.\nHowever, thematic investing presents unique challenges related to transparency in asset selection. A primary concern is the opacity in asset selection criteria for these funds, which raises questions about how closely their portfolios truly align with advertised themes. This lack of clarity complicates the evaluation process for investors, who may find it difficult to determine whether a thematic ETF genuinely reflects the underlying trends it claims to target (Raghunandan and Rajgopal, 2022). For instance, while technology-themed ETFs promote exposure to innovation, the predictive nature of thematic investing inherently carries speculative risks due to its reliance on forward-looking assumptions about technological trends and adoption rates (Blitz, 2021a). Ben-David et al. (2023) highlight that specialized ETFs tend to underperform over their first five years, with about a 30% risk- adjusted loss. This underperformance is linked to the overvaluation of underlying stocks at the time of the launch, suggesting that providers cater to investors' extrapolative beliefs by issuing ETFs that focus on attention-grabbing themes rather than delivering sustainable value. These factors collectively"}, {"title": "3. Data Background and Methodology", "content": "To construct our empirical dataset, we begin by extracting a complete list of all 4,316 assets listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange from January 1, 2010, to September 1, 2022, using the Nasdaq stock screener tool. 1 2 The Nasdaq was specifically selected due to its historical preference for a more accommodating listing of technology firms, a factor that contributes to its reputation as a primarily technology-oriented exchange. This is evident in its substantial weighting towards technology companies, including those specializing in artificial intelligence (Nasdaq, 2024). For each stock, we obtained the historical daily closing price and Central Index Key (CIK) from the S&P Capital IQ"}, {"title": "3.2. Measuring AI in Stocks", "content": "To measure the extent to which each of the 3,395 stocks is related to AI, we firstly begin by utilizing the advanced search function of the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) database to collect the annual 10-K filings for each stock over the sample period. The 10-K filings are comprehensive reports that publicly traded companies file annually to disclose their financial performance. Mandated by the SEC, these filings provide detailed information on a company's financial health, including earnings, expenses, assets, liabilities, and other relevant metrics. They serve as essential tools for investors and analysts, offering deep insights into a company's operations, market position, and strategic direction (Mishra et al., 2022). Notably, the 10-K filings often contain references to the company's engagement with emerging technologies like AI, shedding light on their strategic priorities and innovation initiatives.\nSecondly, the text of each filing was cleaned and tokenized. This process, which is a fundamental preprocessing step in natural language processing (NLP), involves breaking down the text into smaller units called tokens, such as words or phrases. This helps in analyzing the text more effectively. For instance, the phrase 'we utilize artificial intelligence' would be tokenized into individual words: ['we', 'utilize', 'artificial', 'intelligence']. This step ensures that our analysis is based on a clear and manageable set of data.\nThirdly, to systematically quantify AI-related activity for each stock, specifically in each company's 10- K filings, we conducted a bibliometric analysis using the Web of Science (WoS) database to identify pertinent Al-related terms. Specifically, we used the search string TS=\"artificial intelligence*\" to extract the 500 most recent WoS articles containing this term in their titles or abstracts. Using VOSviewer software (van Eck and Waltman, 2010), we derived the most common keywords, which included general terms such as \"classification\" (N = 20) and \"prediction\" (N = 10) but also more related keywords such as \"machine learning\" (N = 53), \"deep learning\" (N = 27), \"neural network*\" (N = 21) or \"blockchain\" (N = 6). However, to maintain focus on AI-specific disclosures, we restricted our analysis to the following core keywords: (1) \"artificial intelligence*,\" (2) \"ai,\" and (3) \"a.i.\". These keywords formed the foundation of our analysis, enabling us to construct an objective measure of AI involvement across firms based on their 10-K public disclosures.\nFourthly, we calculated the frequency of each AI-related keyword within the SEC filings Ci to quantitatively measure the degree of AI engagement for each firm (Equation 1):"}, {"title": "3.3. Construction of AI Indices", "content": "We construct four distinct AI stock indices, including the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), Size- Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time-Discounted AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X), which reflect the intensity and persistence of AI-related disclosures in corporate annual filings, utilizing the metrics developed in section 3.3. These indices are developed to provide investors with a more objective and data-driven approach to evaluating corporate AI engagement and its impact on market performance, ensuring an unbiased and reliable evaluation.5\nThe Equally Weighted Artificial Intelligence Stock Index (AII) serves as a baseline measure, incorporating all companies that mention AI in their latest (i.e., last year's) annual filings, regardless of the extent of their communication. This approach assumes equal potential impact from any Al disclosure, providing a broad view of the market's engagement with AI without giving undue emphasis to any individual firm's disclosure intensity. The index provides a simple aggregation of the overall market's Al engagement.\nThe weight assigned to each company i in year t, denoted as wit is defined as $\\frac{1}{Nt}$ if the company mentions AI in their latest annual filing, where Nt is the total number of companies. The AII is thereby formulated as:"}, {"title": "4. Empirical Model and Results", "content": "Mentioning AI in a company's 10-K filing does not necessarily indicate active AI utilization or qualify the company as an AI-focused stock. To assess the accuracy of our AI stock classification measures in identifying a company's engagement with AI, we initiate the empirical investigation by explicitly testing their response to the launch of ChatGPT. Previous research in crypto asset markets (Ante and Demir, 2024; Saggu and Ante, 2023) demonstrates that the launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, generated significant interest in AI, resulting in greater cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs) for Al-focused crypto assets compared to non-AI crypto assets. We hypothesize that a similar effect occurred in stock markets, leading to positive abnormal returns for AI-focused stocks. While asset managers who select AI-themed ETF compositions may not necessarily possess deep technological expertise and may use arbitrary inclusion criteria, individual investors with specialized knowledge of specific companies are more likely to accurately assess a company's AI involvement, which should be reflected in their response to the ChatGPT event."}, {"title": "4.2. The Predictive Power of AI Indices on Abnormal Returns", "content": "Building upon the statistically significant differences observed between AI and non-AI stocks in Figure 3, we extend our analysis to examine how effectively our AI indices explain the CAARs following the launch of ChatGPT. Table 3 presents the regression results predicting CAARs for all 2,541 NASDAQ- listed stocks in our sample. The primary objective is to evaluate whether the AI indices described in Section 3.3 serve as significant predictors of the abnormal returns observed after this event."}, {"title": "4.3. Analysis of Abnormal Returns in AI-classified Stocks", "content": "Building upon the analysis of CAARs across all NASDAQ-listed stocks (Section 4.2), we refine our focus to examine the subset of 582 stocks classified as AI-related based on our NLP-based methodology. Specifically, we aim to assess how effectively the Size-Weighted Artificial Intelligence Index (SAII) metrics for 2022 and 2023 explain the abnormal returns of these AI stocks following the launch of ChatGPT. Table 3 presents the regression results employing both OLS and robust MM- estimator techniques to evaluate this relationship. In these regressions, the independent variables are the index weights derived from the SAII for the years 2022 and 2023. These weights quantify the degree of AI-related disclosures by companies within the AI stock classification, effectively serving as proxies for the intensity of AI engagement as communicated through their 10-K filings.\nThe regression results indicate statistically significant positive coefficients for both the 2022 and 2023 SAII metrics, which reveal that a higher degree of AI-related disclosure is associated with greater CAARs among AI stocks following the ChatGPT launch. This finding supports the validity of our NLP- based classification method, demonstrating that the extent of AI engagement, as captured by our SAII metrics, has a meaningful and positive relationship with abnormal stock returns in the context of a significant AI-related market event. However, the absence of a comparative baseline or alternative AI classification methods limits our ability to fully assess the relative effectiveness and robustness of our NLP-based approach. Future research could enhance this analysis by incorporating additional variables or employing alternative AI engagement measures to provide a more comprehensive evaluation."}, {"title": "4.4. Comparative Evaluation of AI Engagement in Indices and ETFs", "content": "To evaluate the effectiveness of our AI stock classification methodology at the index level, we compare the performance of our four Al indices with that of existing AI-themed ETFs and the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) following the launch of ChatGPT. We conduct an event study using daily returns for our indices, the 12 AI-focused ETFs identified in Table 1, and the IXIC. The rationale is that if our NLP- based Al indices effectively capture AI-related market dynamics, they should exhibit significant positive abnormal returns in response to the ChatGPT launch, similar to existing AI ETFs designed to provide exposure to AI-related investments.\nAs reported in Table 4, all four of our Al indices experienced statistically significant positive cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) over the three-month event window, with an average CAR of 17.48%.8 Specifically, the CARs for our indices ranged from 16.19% to 20.97%, with corresponding t-statistics all significant at the 5% level. This indicates that our indices effectively captured the positive market reaction associated with the ChatGPT launch. In comparison, only half of the existing AI ETFs (6 out of 12) exhibited significant positive abnormal returns over the same period, with an average CAR of 17.58% among these six ETFs. When considering all 12 AI ETFs, the average CAR was 13.00%; excluding the outlier ROBT\u2014which had a negative CAR of -15.37%\u2014the average CAR increased to 15.58%. Notably, three of the existing AI ETFs (IRBO, ARKQ, and BOTZ) reported the largest positive market reactions, with CARs of 22.80% and 21.40%.\nOur four Al indices ranked fourth to seventh in terms of CAR magnitude among all indices and ETFs analyzed.

Comprehensive Performance Assessment of AI Indices and ETFs", "content": "We extend our investigation to evaluate the overall performance of these indices relative to existing AI- focused ETFs and the broader market. This comprehensive assessment aims to examine both the short- term responsiveness and the long-term risk and return characteristics of our indices, providing a more holistic view of their effectiveness as investment vehicles in the AI sector. To achieve this, we employ a range of traditional financial performance metrics consistent with established practices in financial research (H\u00e4usler and Xia, 2022; Schr\u00f6der, 2007; Zatlavi et al., 2014), allowing for a detailed evaluation over the period from June 27, 2019, to September 1, 2023. This time frame represents the longest common period with available market data for all indices and ETFs under consideration.\nCentral to our analysis is the average daily return percentage, (Ret) which reflects the average daily percentage change in the value of an ETF or index. This metric provides a foundational comparison of the returns generated by different investment instruments. To assess risk, we examine the standard deviation (SD) of returns, which measures the volatility or variability of returns over the specified period. A higher SD indicates greater fluctuation in returns, suggesting higher investment risk. Additionally, we analyze skewness (Skew) and kurtosis (Kurt) to gain insights into the distribution of returns. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the return distribution. At the same time, kurtosis indicates the propensity for extreme values, both of which are crucial for understanding tail risks and the likelihood of significant deviations from the mean return, offering insights into the asymmetry and extremity of returns.\nIn order to contextualize the performance of our Al indices and ETFs relative to the broader market, we compute alpha and beta coefficients using the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) as the benchmark market portfolio. Alpha (a) represents the intercept in a regression of the index, or ETF returns, against market returns, indicating the ability of the investment to generate excess returns independent of market movements. A positive alpha suggests outperformance relative to the market. Beta (\u03b2) measures the sensitivity of the investment's returns to market movements, quantifying systematic risk. A beta greater than one indicates higher volatility compared to the market, while a beta less than one suggests lower volatility. We further evaluate the risk-adjusted performance using the Sharpe Ratio (SR), calculated as:"}, {"title": "5.

Implications for Theory", "content": "The findings of this study have meaningful theoretical implications in the fields of finance and innovation, particularly concerning the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in contemporary markets. Firstly, our research contributes to the literature on market reactions to technological advancements by providing a tangible metric that quantifies the market's perception of AI's value within stocks. By developing an Al measure based on natural language processing (NLP) analysis of corporate filings, we enhance existing theories on investor behavior in response to technological innovations (Aharon et al., 2022; Cahill et al., 2020). Consistent with the Efficient Market Hypothesis (Fama, 1970), our results suggest that markets can rapidly assimilate and respond to information regarding a company's engagement with AI technologies.\nSecondly, this study enriches the discourse on thematic investing (Somefun et al., 2023). Our findings- particularly the competitive performance of AI indices relative to established AI-themed exchange- traded funds (ETFs)\u2014support the notion that thematic investments, when well-constructed and data- driven, can be both effective and cost-efficient. This insight adds depth to the existing literature on thematic investments and ETFs (Blitz, 2021b; Dheeriya and Malladi, 2019; Methling and von Nitzsch, 2019), suggesting that objective, data-driven methodologies can enhance the effectiveness of thematic investment strategies.\nThirdly, our research contributes to the strategic management literature by more closely linking Al integration in corporate strategies with firm valuation and competitive advantage (Kar et al., 2021; Keding, 2021). By demonstrating how AI integration is perceived and valued by the market, we expand on theories that explore psychological factors influencing investment decisions in behavioral finance (Bajo et al., 2023; Barber and Odean, 2013).\nFourthly, our results prompt a re-examination of the role of corporate disclosure in an era increasingly dominated by AI and technology. They suggest the need for new frameworks to assess the quality and impact of such disclosures, particularly in technology-driven sectors. The NLP-based measure introduced in this study exemplifies how qualitative information can be transformed into a quantifiable metric with significant market relevance. This resonates with the current shift towards more sophisticated data analysis methods in financial research and emphasizes the importance of technological literacy in financial market analysis."}, {"title": "5.2.

This remarkable performance reflects Al's escalating prominence in the investment landscape and offers new opportunities for portfolio diversification and growth. Investors can leverage the insights from our AI stock measure to identify companies deeply integrated with AI technologies, potentially leading to enhanced returns and aligning their portfolios with cutting-edge technological advancements.\nSecondly, for fund managers and index providers, the findings present a compelling case for adopting more data-driven and transparent methodologies in constructing thematic indices. The competitive performance of the AI indices developed in this research\u2014rooted in objective analyses using publicly available corporate data\u2014suggests that such methods can yield outcomes comparable to, or even surpass, those achieved by existing thematic ETFs. This approach could enhance competition among index providers, potentially resulting in reduced costs for ETFs and investors (An et al., 2023). Moreover, the methodology employed in this study could revolutionize thematic index construction, serving as a blueprint for developing similar measures across other thematic areas. By harnessing technologies like NLP, fund managers and analysts can extract actionable insights from corporate filings, enabling the formulation of more nuanced and accurate investment strategies.\nThirdly, regulators and policymakers might find value in these findings, as they highlight the importance of transparent corporate disclosures in promoting market efficiency.

Limitations and Future Research", "content": "This study, while providing valuable insights, is subject to several limitations that offer avenues for future research and refinement. Firstly, our reliance on publicly available corporate disclosures, specifically 10-K filings, means that our quantitative analysis may not capture all dimensions of a company's engagement with AI. A closer examination of these filings reveals that the term \"AI\" is used in varied contexts. Some companies detail how they have integrated AI into their business operations, while others merely mention competitors' use of AI or express intentions to explore AI in the future. Future research could enhance the quality of these metrics by incorporating qualitative assessments or employing more advanced natural language processing techniques to differentiate the context and depth of AI mentions (Frankel et al., 2022).\nSecondly, the utilization of a single data source presents limitations. Companies could theoretically manipulate their Al engagement metrics by frequently mentioning AI without substantive involvement, a phenomenon known as \"AI washing.\" Indeed, in March 2024, the SEC charged two investment advisers for disclosing misleading statements about Al utilization (SEC, 2024), indicating that such manipulation is a genuine concern.

Our approach involved creating both a binary indicator of AI mention and a weighted AI score that reflects the frequency and context of AI-related terms in these disclosures. Using these AI engagement metrics, we constructed four AI stock indices: the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size-Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time-Discounted AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X). These indices differ in how they weigh companies based on their AI involvement and account for historical disclosures, offering alternative perspectives on AI investment opportunities. We then compared the performance of these indices against 12 existing AI-themed ETFs, analyzing their risk-return profiles, market reactions to the ChatGPT launch, and overall investment performance.\nOur validation through an event study centered on the launch of ChatGPT confirmed that companies with higher degrees of Al engagement exhibited more significant positive abnormal returns. This finding demonstrates that our objective measures effectively capture market perceptions of Al involvement. Regression analyses further supported the validity of our metrics, revealing a significant predictive power of our Al measures on the cumulative average abnormal returns observed. Comparative analysis showed that our objectively constructed Al indices perform on par with, or even surpass, existing AI-themed ETFs in terms of market response and investment performance. This suggests that our methodology offers a reliable and market-responsive approach to creating Al stock indices, providing investors with a viable alternative or complement to existing AI-themed investment products. Such an approach could enhance competition among index providers and potentially reduce ETF expense ratios, benefiting investors seeking exposure to the AI sector.\nOur study contributes to the literature on financial markets and corporate disclosures, particularly focusing on Al technology.

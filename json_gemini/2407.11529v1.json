Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is acknowledged as the gold standard imaging tool in clinics, yet it can be contraindicated for emergency department (ED) patients and represents an onerous procedure, thus necessitating PE identification through non-contrast CT (NCT) scans. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying a deep-learning approach to NCT scans for PE identification. We propose a novel Cross-Phase Mutual learNing framework (CPMN) that fosters knowledge transfer from CTPA to NCT, while concurrently conducting embolism segmentation and abnormality classification in a multi-task manner. The proposed CPMN leverages the Inter-Feature Alignment (IFA) strategy that enhances spatial contiguity and mutual learning between the dual-pathway network, while the Intra-Feature Discrepancy (IFD) strategy can facilitate precise segmentation of PE against complex backgrounds for single-pathway networks. For a comprehensive assessment of the proposed approach, a large-scale dual-phase dataset containing 334 PE patients and 1,105 normal subjects has been established. Experimental results demonstrate that CPMN achieves the leading identification performance, which is 95.4% and 99.6% in patient-level sensitivity and specificity on NCT scans, indicating the potential of our approach as an economical, accessible, and precise tool for PE identification in clinical practice.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a critical and potentially lethal pulmonary condition, which occupies the third position in severity, trailing only behind myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death [18]. It typically arises from a thrombotic event within the deep venous network of the lower limbs, which subsequently embarks on a path through the bloodstream, advances to the cardiac region, and culminates in an obstruction within the pulmonary arterial network [8]. The predominant factor contributing to preventable mortality in PE cases is not a therapeutic shortfall, but rather the omission of accurate diagnosis [4].\nWithin the realm of PE diagnostic modalities, computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has emerged as the gold standard imaging tool, facilitating visualization of pulmonary filling defects through the utilization of contrast agents [1]. Unfortunately, certain patient populations within emergency departments (ED) are unable to easily undergo intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, predominantly attributable to renal impairment or hypersensitivity to iodine-based contrast agents [17]. On the contrary, non-contrast computed tomography (NCT) can be performed within seconds and is an economical and accessible tool. Nevertheless, the assessment of NCT scans by radiologists lacks the requisite sensitivity and specificity to dependably diagnose PE [15]. Therefore, developing an automatic and accurate PE identification framework on NCT scans is of paramount importance.\nWith recent advances in deep learning, an increasing number of researchers have devoted efforts to developing automated algorithms for PE identification on CTPA scans [5,23,2]. Huang et al. [5] presented a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for PE identification by decoupling the issue as a classification task, yet it lacks the capability to furnish precise localization. Recently, Yuan et al. [23] proposed a ResD-UNet framework for pulmonary artery segmentation, which enhances accuracy and efficiency through the integration of the U-Net architecture with innovative residual-dense blocks and a composite loss function, thereby tackling the challenge in assessing the severity of PE. Chen et al. [2] introduced an automated segmentation approach for PE, termed SCUNet++, which integrates the strengths of UNet++, multiple fusion dense skip connections, the Swin-Transformer attention mechanism, and the Swin-UNet architecture. Conversely, the realm of PE identification on NCT scans remains comparatively underexplored [19]. Previous research [22] targeting the pancreas has demonstrated that deep learning methodologies are capable of discerning nuanced textural and morphological alterations in NCT scans, which may elude even the observation of human experts. However, the feasibility of PE identification through NCT scans is still an open question, primarily due to the low contrast differentiation between the embolism and surrounding pulmonary vessels on NCT scans, compounded by the diverse morphological presentations of embolisms, which intensify this identification challenge.\nTo tackle the aforementioned issues and leverage dual-phase knowledge, we propose a novel Cross-Phase Mutual learNing framework (CPMN) for PE identification on NCT scans. In this work, the identification task is decoupled into"}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "Problem Formulation. In the training stage, given a set of pair-wise data, namely NCT and CTPA volume, the entire dataset is denoted by $S = \\{(X_i^c, X_i^t, Y_i, M_i)\\}_{i = 1, 2, ..., N}$, where $X_i^c$ and $X_i^t$ are the i-th NCT and CTPA volume, with $Y_i$ being the voxel-wise segmentation label map of the same size as $X_i^c$ and K channels. Here, K = 2 represents the background and embolism. $M_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the classification label of the image, where 0 stands for \"normal\" and 1 for \"PE\". In the testing stage, solely the NCT volume $X_i^c$ is provided, and the objective is to predict abnormality probability and generate an embolism mask.\nMutual Learning Framework. In this section, we present our mutual learning framework designed for dual-phase medical image analysis, leveraging CTPA and NCT volumes. Our approach enhances the performance and generalization of the NCT-pathway network through a novel mutual learning strategy (MLS).\nAs shown in Fig 1, our proposed mutual learning framework is designed to simultaneously train two CNNs with distinct tasks, classification, and segmentation. The CTPA-pathway network, denoted as $\\Omega_1$, is tasked with classification and segmenting PE in CTPA volumes. Conversely, the NCT-pathway network, $\\Omega_2$, operates on NCT volumes. We choose U-Net [14] 3D version with EfficientNet-B0 [16] 3D version as the encoder for segmentation task and add an auxiliary classifier $O_{i, i \\in \\{1,2\\}}$ with architecture avg-pool $\\rightarrow$ FC layer $\\rightarrow$ Relu $\\rightarrow$ FC layer, after encoder. The architecture is the same for both pathways.\nBoth networks are trained in parallel, as well as leveraging the MLS that fosters knowledge transfer from $\\Omega_1$ to $\\Omega_2$. This is achieved by minimizing a divergence loss that aligns the predictive distributions of the two networks. We"}, {"title": "Inter-Feature Alignment (IFA).", "content": "In our mutual learning framework, akin to the pair-wise Markov random field approach for enhancing spatial labeling contiguity, we focus on similarity among spatial features from the CTPA-pathway network $\\Omega_2$ to the NCT-pathway network $\\Omega_1$.

This graph is parameterized by connection range $\\alpha$ and granularity $\\beta$, optimizing the graph's resolution and the fidelity of spatial relations captured. The affinity graph, with $W'H'$ nodes and $W'H' \\times \\alpha$ connections, serve as a dynamic representation of spatial correlations, enhancing the mutual learning process between the networks $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_2$.\nTo quantify the knowledge transfer between them and foster the mutual learning process, we introduce a pair-wise similarity distillation loss, integrating"}, {"title": "Intra-Feature Discrepancy (IFD).", "content": "To enhance our segmentation model's capability to distinguish discriminative features between the background and the pulmonary embolism, we propose an IFD strategy that is based on designed dense center loss derived from center loss [21], traditionally used in classification tasks.

Each case encompasses a CTPA scan in conjunction with the corresponding NCT phase. We use the latest patients in 2022 as a hold-out test set, resulting in a training set of 269 PE patients and 881 normal subjects, and a test set of 65 PE patients and 224 normal subjects. We randomly selected 20% of the training data as an internal validation set. LapIRN [13] is employed to register the CTPA phase to the NCT phase, and then invite an experienced radiologist to annotate labels on the CTPA phase using CTLabeler [20]. The segmentation mask and the class label are annotated based on radiology reports and clinical records. Public Benchmark: The FUMPE dataset [12] is one of the largest publicly available datasets in this field containing 8,792 CTPA images obtained from 35 patients. The partitioning of the training and test datasets aligns with the methodology delineated in prior research [2].\n3.2 Implementation Details\nWe developed our segmentation models using PyTorch, with experiments conducted on two NVIDIA A100 GPUs. We set the training batch size to 6, with transformations including random flips and rotations with 10% probabilities, spatial padding, and random cropping to a uniform size of 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 96. During the inference stage, we use sliding-window inference with patch size 224\u00d7224\u00d796, and the center patch is cropped with the same size as the input for the classification head. The Adam [7] optimizer, with a learning rate of 0.001, is paired with a Cosine Annealing learning [11] rate scheduler that strategically modulates the learning rate over the training epochs, with the minimum rate set at 1 \u00d7 10-5.\n3.3 Evaluation Metrics and Reader Study\nFor the binary classification task, model performance is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity (Sens.), and specificity (Spec.). For the segmentation task, the dice coefficient is utilized to assess model performance. A reader study was carried out involving three radiologists in cardiopulmonary imaging: an expert radiologist (12 years experience), a senior radiologist (8 years experience), and a junior radiologist (3 years experience). The readers were given 289 non-contrast CT scans from the test set and asked to provide a binary decision for each scan, determining the presence or absence of PE. They conducted their evaluations without access to any patient information or medical records. Additionally, readers were apprised that the dataset could exhibit a higher incidence of PE cases compared to the typical prevalence encountered in routine screenings, but the exact distribution of case types was not revealed to them. Utilizing the ITK-SNAP software [25], the radiologists interpreted the CT scans, free from any time limitations."}, {"title": "3.4 Results", "content": "Ablation Study. To verify the contribution of each component, the ablation study is carried out, and the results are reported in Table 1. As for single-phase, our baseline model achieves 96.9%, 99.6%, 0.996, and 79.9% in patient-level sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and segmentation dice on CTPA scans, while realizing 84.6%, 97.8%, 0.973, and 68.8% on NCT scans.

Concurrently, there is a notable enhancement in patient-level sensitivity by 3.1%, culminating at 95.4%. It proves the importance of the designed IFD strategy.\nComparison with Literature. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed CPMN, we conduct a comparison with various state-of-the-art methods on two different datasets. (1) ALD-PE: Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of our proposed CPMN with four baselines. The first baseline is DML [26] based on mutual learning. The other three baselines (denoted as \"-Joint\") integrate a CNN classification head into each network and are trained in an end-to-end manner. Quantitative results show that our proposed CPMN achieves the leading classification and segmentation performance, particularly in sensitivity and segmentation dice.

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Existing research on substation fault analysis primarily relies on traditional manual expertise and simple detection models [1]. However, these methods face significant challenges when dealing with complex equipment failures [2]. Substation equipment faults often involve various intricate factors, such as transformer damage and cable insulation failure, which traditional methods struggle to comprehensively capture and analyze. Additionally, current fault detection systems often focus solely on preliminary identification and fail to delve into the root causes of faults or provide effective repair recommendations, making fault analysis more challenging and time-consuming [3]. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate advanced multimodal large model (MLLM) technologies to develop intelligent fault analysis systems. Such systems would not only enhance fault detection accuracy but also provide in-depth analysis of fault causes and targeted repair recommendations, significantly improving the management and maintenance efficiency of substation equipment.\nIn recent years, multi-modal large models (e.g., GPT-4 [4]) have gained attention for their outstanding ability to process and integrate various types of data, such as text [5] [6], images [7] [8], and time series [9]. These models can synthesize information from different data sources to offer more comprehensive solutions in complex application scenarios. For instance, GPT-4 has demonstrated exceptional performance in multi-modal understanding and generation. Compared to traditional single-modal models, it exhibits superior generalization and precision when handling multiple data inputs. This capability has enabled multimodal large models to excel in tasks such as image generation [10] [11], cross-modal retrieval [12] [13], and complex reasoning [14] [15], presenting new opportunities for professional fields like equipment fault analysis. By combining different data types, these models can achieve more precise and comprehensive analysis and decision support.\nWhile multi-modal large models excel in handling diverse data types, they often underperform in specialized domains due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge [16], particularly in substation equipment fault analysis. These models struggle to interpret fault images, identify fault types, analyze root causes, and provide improvement suggestions.\nThis paper introduces SubstationAI, a multi-modal large language model specifically designed for substation fault analysis. Utilizing the substation defect detection dataset from the China Electric Power Research Institute and the State Grid Corporation of China's guidelines, we developed detailed fault"}, {"title": "II. TASK SETUP", "content": "This task generates detailed fault analysis reports from substation fault images. The input consists of fault images and prompts that guide the model in report generation. The output is a fault analysis report that identifies the fault type, analyzes the causes, and provides repair recommendations. The mathematical formula is as follows:\n$R = GenReport (Fuse (ImgFeat(I), TxtEnc(P))) = (T, C', S)$\nIn this formula, Here, $R$ represents the generated report. $ImgFeat(I)$ denotes the image feature extractor applied to the fault image $I$, and $TxtEnc(P)$ refers to the text encoder used for processing the prompt $P$. The function $Fuse$ is the fusion function that combines the image features and text encodings. $GenReport$ is the report generation function. The generated report $R$ consists of three main components: $T$ indicates the fault type, $C$ represents the fault cause analysis, and $S$ provides the repair suggestions."}, {"title": "A. Evaluation metrics", "content": "Existing metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE are typically used for tasks like translation and summarization. However, due to the specific context of substation fault analysis, these metrics do not fully address the evaluation needs for substation fault analysis reports. Based on discussions with electrical power experts and considering the practical requirements of substation fault analysis, as well as referencing metrics from fields such as healthcare [17] [18], education [19], and software engineering [20], we have identified four key characteristics that a high-quality substation fault analysis report should exhibit:\n\u2022 Accuracy: The report should accurately identify the fault type and cause, providing detailed descriptions of the specific fault, potential reasons, and impact. Vague fault descriptions or lack of technical details can lead to misleading conclusions, indicating a lack of professionalism.\n\u2022 Clarity: The report should convey fault information in clear and concise language, systematically presenting fault descriptions, impact scope, and repair steps. Overly complex information or obscure terminology can confuse users and reduce the report's effectiveness.\n\u2022 Completeness: The report should comprehensively consider all possible fault causes and provide detailed analysis and repair suggestions. If only partial causes are listed or repair advice is omitted, it may fail to offer an effective solution.\n\u2022 Practicality: The report should provide feasible repair suggestions and clear steps to effectively guide maintenance work. Abstract or vague recommendations may complicate the repair process and reduce the report's practicality.\nThese four metrics are crucial for evaluating substation fault analysis reports. Only reports that excel in these areas can significantly enhance the accuracy of fault diagnosis and the efficiency of equipment maintenance. Based on these metrics, we have established the following scoring standards, defining a rating scale from 1 to 5, from low to high, to ensure the independence and objectivity of the evaluation process."}, {"title": "III. DATASETS", "content": ""}, {"title": "A. Dataset Source", "content": "The dataset utilized in this study is primarily derived from the publicly available substation defect detection dataset provided by the China Electric Power Research Institute [21].

Dataset Construction", "content": "Based on the \"Guidelines for the Assessment of the Condition of Power Transmission and Transformation Equipment\" [22] by State Grid Corporation of China, we have developed corresponding prompts for different fault types. These prompts, along with defect images, were input into the GPT-4 model to generate fault analysis reports that include fault categories, causes, and repair recommendations. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the reports, we enlisted five electrical experts to conduct a secondary review of the generated reports and corrected any unreasonable elements. Additionally, to expand the dataset, we used the image-to-video generation model EasyAnimate [23] to convert substation fault images into videos with panning effects. Each video lasts for 6 seconds, enhancing the diversity and applicability of the dataset. We captured screenshots every 1.5 seconds from each video to obtain images from different perspectives. This process increased the dataset to 40,000 images, as illustrated in Figure 2."}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY", "content": "The model's responses sometimes lack electrical expertise and relevance. For example, in the analysis of a damaged transformer breather, it may respond simply with \u201cBreather damage detected, please repair promptly,\" lacking cause analysis and specific repair suggestions. By integrating a knowledge base for knowledge enhancement, the model can generate more professional and comprehensive analysis reports.For instance:\n\u2022 Fault Type: Damage to the oil-immersed transformer breather\n\u2022 Fault Cause: Excessive internal pressure leading to aging or failure of the breather's sealing material\n\u2022 Repair Recommendations: Check the breather for cracks or damage and replace it if necessary. Inspect the internal pressure of the transformer to ensure it is within normal ranges...\nThis enhancement method allows for a more detailed description of the fault type, specific causes, and repair suggestions, significantly improving the professionalism and practicality of the response."}, {"title": "A.

Ablation experiment", "content": "To validate the effectiveness of each method, we conducted ablation experiments, testing the use of only SFT, only knowledge enhancement, and replacing knowledge enhancement with Zero-shot-CoT [35]. The resultsII, as shown in Table 2, indicate that SFT had the most significant impact on improving the model's performance across various metrics. Although the enhancement effect of knowledge enhancement alone was less pronounced than SFT, its combination with SFT led to further performance gains. In contrast, Zero-shot-CoT's performance was somewhat limited, likely due to the absence of professional knowledge prompts."}, {"title": "E.

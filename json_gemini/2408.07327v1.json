Designing an effective strategy for managing multiple traffic lights plays a crucial role in managing congestion. However, most current traffic light management systems rely on human-crafted decisions, which may not adapt well to diverse traffic patterns. In this paper, we delve into two pivotal design components of the traffic light management system that can be dynamically adjusted to various traffic conditions: phase combination and phase time allocation. While numerous studies have sought an efficient strategy for managing traffic lights, most of these approaches consider a fixed traffic pattern and are limited to relatively small road networks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel and practical framework to formulate the optimization of such design components using an offline meta black-box optimization. We then present a simple yet effective method to efficiently find a solution for the aforementioned problem. In our framework, we first collect an offline meta dataset consisting of pairs of design choices and corresponding congestion measures from various traffic patterns. After collecting the dataset, we employ the Attentive Neural Process (ANP) to predict the impact of the proposed design on congestion across various traffic patterns with well-calibrated uncertainty. Finally, Bayesian optimization, with ANP as a surrogate model, is utilized to find an optimal design for unseen traffic patterns through limited online simulations. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on complex road networks in terms of the number of waiting vehicles. Surprisingly, the deployment of our method into a real-world traffic system was able to improve traffic throughput by 4.80% compared to the original strategy.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Traffic congestion is a growing problem caused by the rise in the number of vehicles and the complexity of urban road networks, leading to wasted time and harmful emissions [2]. In highly developed cities with intricate road networks, solving congestion by modifying or extending the existing traffic infrastructure is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, an intelligent traffic light management system emerges as a promising method to alleviate congestion in urban areas [23].\nSeveral components of the traffic light management system can be adjusted to significantly mitigate overall road network congestion. First, we can determine which combination of phases should be assigned to each traffic light. After selecting the combination, we decide the proportion allocated to each phase (also known as the green split). Both components are crucial for coordinating multiple traffic lights to reduce congestion.\nMany traffic engineering methods have been proposed to derive an efficient strategy for managing traffic lights on urban road networks. Classical methods attempt to formulate the green split optimization as mathematical programming, like mixed integer programming. They often rely on strong assumptions such as uniform vehicle arrival rates and fixed right-turn ratios [31, 42, 49, 52]. While these methods have shown promising results [32], they focus only on single or axis-aligned intersections, and their assumptions may not match well with complex traffic networks. Recent approaches formulate the problem as a black-box optimization and apply various algorithms, including genetic algorithms [30, 58], particle swarm optimization [6, 7], and Bayesian optimization [22, 46]. However, these methods typically solve the problem under a fixed traffic pattern, necessitating an optimization from scratch when a new traffic pattern emerges.\nTo overcome the aforementioned limitations, we present a novel and practical framework that can adaptively find an optimal design of phase combination and time allocation for diverse traffic patterns. We treat the optimization of such design components as an offline meta black-box optimization. Within this framework, our aim is to find an optimal design for an unseen traffic pattern with a limited number of online simulations while leveraging prior knowledge from a previously collected offline meta dataset.\nWe propose a simple yet effective method to solve the formulated problem. Our key idea is a novel combination of Attentive Neural Process (ANP) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Initially, we gather an offline meta dataset comprising pairs of design choices and their corresponding traffic measures from various traffic patterns. After collecting the dataset, we train ANP to predict the performance of the proposed design on different traffic patterns with well-calibrated uncertainty, which is crucial in the offline meta-training process. Subsequently, we integrate the trained ANP model with BO as a means of surrogate model. This integration allows us to effectively utilize the capability of performance prediction on various traffic patterns with well-calibrated uncertainty of the ANP model, enabling us to find an optimal design for unseen traffic patterns with limited online evaluations.\nOur method exhibits superior performance across diverse road networks with realistic traffic patterns. Moreover, we also deploy our method into real-world traffic light management systems on urban road networks and demonstrate that our method improves traffic flow compared to the original strategy."}, {"title": "2 Preliminaries", "content": "In this section, we define some terminologies regarding traffic lights and road network systems.\nDefinition 2.1.1 (Traffic Network and Traffic Lights). Traffic network can be defined as a graph G = (V, E), where V is a set of intersections and E is a set of lanes that connect adjacent intersections. Each intersection is equipped with a traffic light device that determines the order and direction of vehicle movements in all lanes at the intersection.\nDefinition 2.1.2 (Traffic Pattern): Traffic pattern p can be defined as a set of vehicle movements, {(o\u2081, d\u2081, t\u2081), (o\u2082, d\u2082, t\u2082),..., (o\u1d65, d\u1d65, t\u1d65)}, where (o\u1d65, d\u1d65) represents an origin-destination (OD) pair and t\u1d65 denotes the departure time of the o\u1d57\u02b0 vehicle.\nDefinition 2.1.3 (Traffic Light Phase). Traffic light phase refers to a specific set of traffic movements that are allowed. During a specific phase, only certain vehicular or pedestrian actions are permitted. Common movements include going straight, turning left, and valid combinations of various movements.\nDefinition 2.1.4 (Traffic Light Phase Combination). Traffic signal phase combination comprises a set of traffic signal phases. Most real-world traffic lights determine phase combination as 4~5 number of signal phases and execute them in an iterative manner.\nDefinition 2.1.5 (Traffic Light Phase Time Allocation). Once the traffic light determines the phase combination to circle, we can decide the proportion of time allocated to each phase given a fixed cycle time. Phase time allocation refers to such ratio, and it is also often called a green split in transportation literature [9]."}, {"title": "2.2 Black-box Optimization", "content": "Black-box optimization (BBO) has become a de-facto framework to formulate the optimization problem where the oracle function is non-convex and non-differentiable.

Unfortunately, naive BBO algorithms start the optimization process from scratch when encountering new problems. To mitigate this issue, researchers turn their eyes to leveraging prior knowledge to accelerate the optimization process for the new black-box function [10, 39, 57].

Unlike Gaussian Processes (GP, [41]), which have a pre-defined prior for modeling a target function, NP can learn a data-driven prior, enabling them to represent a wide range of complex distributions of functions.\nFormally, NP introduces a latent variable z and uses neural networks to model encoder and decoder networks. Let \u03b8 and \u00f8 be parameters of the encoder and decoder of NP, respectively. Given context set  Dctx = {(xc, yc)}|C|c=1 and target set  Dtar = {(xt, yt)}|C|+|T|t=C+1, the NP encoder first learns a representation rc = Ep(xc, yc) for each context. These representations are aggregated to obtain a global representation rctx, which is used for parameterizing the distribution of a latent variable z ~ q\u00f8(z|rctx). Finally, given the sampled latent variable z, the NP decoder returns the predictive distribution of the target set as follows:\n|C|+|T|\n\u03a0 Po(Yt|Xt, z) = \u03a0 N(Yt|\u03bc\u03b8(xt, z), \u03c3\u00b2\u03b8(xt, z)) (3)\nt=C+1\nt=C+1\nWe train the parameters of NP to maximize the target log-likelihood.

ANP introduces a self-attention module to model higher-order interactions between context pairs while preserving permutation invariance. To predict the target output, ANP employs a cross-attention module instead of mean aggregation so that the target input attends more closely to context representations relevant to the prediction."}, {"title": "2.4 Bayesian Optimization", "content": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is one of the popular techniques to solve black-box optimization.

Several acquisition functions have been proposed, including upper confidence bound (UCB, [44]), expected improvement (EI, [35]), and probability of improvement (PI, [28]).

Given a traffic network G with I intersections and a proposed phase time allocation design x, our objective function f is a mapping from the chosen design x to the congestion measure. This measure is specified by deploying such design into the traffic system under traffic pattern p.\nCongestion measure could be a negative of the average number of waiting vehicles or traffic throughput. As such metrics have no analytically closed form, we can only observe the output y = f(x)+\u0454 corresponding to the given input, with other intrinsic information remaining hidden. It is a common black-box optimization setting where we should iteratively explore the domain space through trial and error until achieving a satisfactory solution."}, {"title": "3.2 Offline Meta Dataset", "content": "Now we define offline meta dataset D, which consists of input-output pairs from various objective functions.

Firstly, most RL-based methods define an action as selecting the next phase from a pre-defined set of phases with short decision intervals. This approach can lead to frequent and inconsistent phase transitions, potentially confusing drivers [8, 37].

Note that because we cannot compare different operating systems in the completely same environment, we choose the week from the same month that has the most similar traffic pattern.\nTable 9 compares the performance of the proposed method with the original fixed-time strategy used in practice. As shown in the table, our method improves the overall throughput by an average of 4.80% compared with the original fixed-time strategy.shows the overall performance of our method compared to the original fixed-time strategy across three days. Our method improves the traffic flow most of the time except few hours. It should be noted that our method has manifested substantial improvement in the real traffic system despite its low implementation cost."}, {"title": "7 Related Works", "content": "7.1 Traffic Light Optimization\nOptimizing multiple traffic lights in urban road networks to alleviate traffic congestion has been widely studied. [30], [58] apply genetic algorithm to determine the optimal phase time allocation while Dabiri and Abbas [6], Dong et al. [7] introduce particle swarm optimization to optimize the phase time allocation for the overall traffic network. Recently, Tay and Osorio [46] propose a Bayesian optimization-based approach tailored for large-scale traffic networks. These methods effectively find appropriate traffic light designs but possess limitations. They require extensive simulation-based evaluations, initiating the optimization process from scratch for distinct traffic patterns. While our method aligns with the literature by formulating the design optimization as a black-box optimization, it distinguishes itself by leveraging prior knowledge from previously collected offline meta dataset for fast adaptation to unseen traffic patterns.\n7.2 Meta Black-box Optimization\nTo overcome the aforementioned limitations, meta-learning based black-box optimization has been proposed. Tjarko Lange et al. [47] meta-learn to recombine solution candidates in CMA-ES via dot-product self-attention. Similarly, Lange et al. [29] parameterize selection and mutation rate in genetic algorithms as cross- and self-attention modules and train them on various tasks.\nThere is also a line of research that tries to make extensions of GP to facilitate meta black-box optimization. Feurer et al. [10] utilize a weighted combination of independent GP models and adjust weight during online adaptation. Perrone et al. [39] utilize a shared feature map coupled with an adaptive Bayesian linear regression layer for each task. Wistuba and Grabocka [57] cast meta Bayesian optimization as a few-shot learning problem and train initial deep kernel parameters via model-agnostic meta-learning [11]. However, a majority of the meta-learning based black-box optimization methods actively utilize online evaluations for various tasks, which is not practical for real-world systems. Contrasting with prior methods, our approach harnesses an offline meta dataset for training a meta prediction model with well-calibrated uncertainty to prevent distributional shift issue during online adaptation process [13, 27]."}, {"title": "8 Conclusion", "content": "In this study, we aim to derive an efficient urban traffic light management system by solving offline meta black-box optimization problems on two pivotal design components: phase combination and phase time allocation. We propose a novel combination of ANP and BO which can identify underlying similarities between traffic patterns and transfer the knowledge effectively from the offline meta dataset to the online adaptation process. We demonstrate the superiority of our novel combination not only on simulation-based various urban road networks with diverse traffic patterns but also on real-world deployment."}, {"title": "A Experiment Details", "content": "In this subsection", "movement": "vehicles can choose lane among turning left, going straight and turning right. For synthetic grid networks, each intersection is separated by a distance of 300m. Real-world road networks are imported from OpenStreetMap.\nA.1.2 Traffic Flow. For synthetic road networks, we pre-define origin-destination (OD) pairs which are mainly composed of four directions (North South, East \u2192 West). To create diverse patterns, we randomly assign the arrival rate for each OD pair. Concretely, we use the Poisson Process with the parameter \u03bb, where \u03bb represents the expected value of generated vehicles per second (arrival rate). Then the time interval between the generation of vehicles, denoted by \u0394t, follows the exponential distribution with \u03bb. For each task, we randomly generate parameters to satisfy \u03bb"}]}

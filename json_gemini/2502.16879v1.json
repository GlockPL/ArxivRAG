We first evaluate five LLMs' economic decision-making capabilities in solving two-period consumption allocation problems under two distinct scenarios: with explicit utility functions and based on intuitive reasoning. While previous research has often simulated heterogeneity by solely varying prompts, our approach harnesses the inherent variations in analytical capabilities across different LLMs to model agents with diverse cognitive traits. Building on these findings, we construct a Multi-LLM-Agent-Based (MLAB) framework by mapping these LLMs to specific educational groups and corresponding income brackets. Using interest-income taxation as a case study, we demonstrate how the MLAB framework can simulate policy impacts across heterogeneous agents, offering a promising new direction for economic and public policy analysis by leveraging LLMs' human-like reasoning capabilities and computational power.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The integration of Large Language Models into economic analysis offers new possibilities for policy research and computational economics. Traditional macroeconomic models, while mathematically rigorous, often rely on strong assumptions of rational expectations and representative agents. These models typically abstract complex economic processes through mathematical formulations such as production functions, which may not fully capture the rich dynamics of R&D, human capital formation, and product evolution in real economies. Moreover, the inherent trade-off between model complexity and tractability has historically limited our ability to incorporate meaningful heterogeneity in agent behaviors and preferences with the exceptions such as Aiyagari (1994), Krusell and Smith (1998) and the TANK and HANK models of Gal\u00ed et al. (2004), Bilbiie (2008), and Kaplan et al. (2018).\nAgent-based models (ABMs) emerged as an alternative approach, allowing for the incorporation of heterogeneous agents with bounded rationality. Early ABMs, as documented by Tesfatsion (2006) and examplified by Brock and Hommes (1998), relied on predetermined rules to govern agent behavior. While these models offered insights into emergent phenomena from individual interactions, they were constrained by the rigidity of their behavioral rules. Recent developments in artificial intelligence, particularly the advent of Large Language Models, offer new possibilities for enhancing the flexibility and sophistication of agent-based modeling.\nA growing body of literature has begun to explore LLMs' potential in economic analysis. Mei et al. (2024) and Ma (2024) demonstrate that LLMs exhibit human-like behavioral characteristics in economic decision-making scenarios. Xie et al. (2024) shows that different AI chatbots exhibit distinct behavioral patterns in games, suggesting that these AI systems are not uniform in their decision-making patterns. Chen et al. (2023) provides evidence of emergent economic rationality in LLMs' choices, while Horton (2023) evaluates their performance in classical behavioral economics games. In a pioneering application of LLMs to agent-based modeling, Li et al. (2024) construct heterogeneous agents by varying the economic situations described in prompts to a single LLM, successfully simulating market dynamics and policy responses. However, their approach captures heterogeneity solely through varied prompts, while implicitly assuming uniform reasoning capabilities and behavioral tendencies across all agents.\nOur paper advances this literature by introducing a two-dimensional approach to modeling heterogeneity. We capture differences not only in economic circumstances through varied prompts but also in reasoning capabilities and behavioral tendencies through the use of different LLMs. This innovation is motivated by the observa-"}, {"title": "2 Evaluating LLMs' Optimization Capabilities with Explicit Utility Functions", "content": "We begin our analysis by evaluating LLMs' capabilities in solving a canonical two-period consumption-savings problem.

The optimization problem is specified as:\n$\\max_{C1,C2} U = u(c_1) + \\beta u(c_2)$ (1)\nwhere\n$u(c) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{c^{1-\\sigma}}{1-\\sigma}, & \\text{if } \\sigma \\neq 1 \\\\ \\ln(c), & \\text{if } \\sigma = 1 \\end{cases}$ (2)"}, {"title": "2.2 Parameter Calibration", "content": "We calibrate our model parameters using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2018 wave, focusing on urban residents.

We then compute age-specific income ratios:\n$k_i = \\frac{y_i}{\\overline{y}}, \\quad i = 1,..., 6$ (8)\nTo project future incomes, we assume a constant annual growth rate of 4%. The average income j decades from now, denoted as \\overline{y}^{j}, is:\n$\\overline{y}^{j} = \\overline{y}(1.04)^{10j}, \\quad j = 0, ...,5$ (9)\nFor our representative agent who starts at age 20-29, their age-specific income in each decade is:\n$y^{a,j} = \\overline{y}^{j}k_i$ (10)\nThis formulation captures both life-cycle income patterns and economic growth. For instance, when our representative agent reaches ages 30-39, their income will be $\\overline{y}^{a,2} = \\overline{y}(1.04)^{10}k_2$.\nTo derive the two-period problem parameters, we calculate:\n$Y_1 = \\overline{y}^{a,3} + \\frac{\\overline{y}^{a,4}}{(1+r)^{10}}$ (11)\n$Y_2 = \\overline{y}^{a,5} + \\frac{\\overline{y}^{a,6}}{(1+r)^{10}}$ (12)\nFor initial wealth (wo), we solve a six-period optimization problem with identical preference parameters (\u03b2, \u03c3) and interest rate (r), starting with zero initial wealth at age 20.

A point above the budget line indicates over-consumption (infeasible solution), while a point below represents under-consumption (inefficient resource utilization). The theoretical optimal point is marked by the intersection of two dashed lines.\nDeepSeek-V3 demonstrates strong optimization capabilities, with most points clustering around the theoretical optimum. While some solutions fall slightly below the budget constraint line, indicating under-consumption, the majority of responses represent efficient resource allocation.\nGPT-40 shows moderate performance, with points generally respecting the budget constraint but displaying greater dispersion around the optimal point.

All models demonstrate consistent emphasis on consumption smoothing, with all 16 responses across each model incorporating this fundamental economic principle. This uniformity suggests that LLMs exhibit human-like lifecycle consumption behavior patterns. Most models also frequently reference intertemporal substitution driven by the high interest rate, though with varying frequencies ranging from 5 to 12 responses, indicating widespread sensitivity to interest rate incentives. Additionally, precautionary saving motives appear across multiple models, although they manifest with different emphases and specific concerns, from health uncertainties to income volatility.\nBeyond these commonalities, each model exhibits distinct characteristics in their decision-making approaches. DeepSeek-V3 demonstrates strong professional orientation through frequent use of economic terminology such as intertemporal budget constraint and consumption smoothing, maintaining the most rigorous economic reasoning framework throughout its responses.\nGemini-1.5-pro displays unique critical thinking by questioning interest rate sustainability despite given conditions and, notably, introducing inflation concerns despite the prompt being framed in real terms.

For each educational category, we perform detailed parameter calibration following the methodology outlined in Section 2. The calibration process begins with extracting six 10-year period income patterns for each educational group.

The framework's innovation lies in its two-dimensional approach to heterogeneity, capturing both economic circumstances and cognitive capabilities through different LLMs.\nTraditional economic models face limitations in addressing individual behavioral heterogeneity and policy simulation flexibility. The MLAB framework addresses these challenges by integrating multiple LLMs to simulate economic decisions across different income groups more flexibly. Our evaluation of LLMs in simulating individual consumption-saving behavior reveals their capacity to demonstrate human-like economic characteristics. The case study of interest income taxation policy demonstrates the model's ability to capture adaptive responses across different tax rates and income groups. Notably, while the present paper employs a pragmatic mapping between LLMs and educational groups, the results affirm that even a relatively coarse alignment can capture meaningful behavioral distinctions across populations, suggesting broader applications in policy analysis.\nFuture research directions focus on several key areas for enhancement. First, the incorporation of more diverse LLMs could provide greater representation of population heterogeneity, potentially capturing additional demographic and socioeconomic segments. Second, developing dynamic agent interactions across income groups would enable more sophisticated modeling of economic behaviors and policy responses. This could include peer effects, social learning, and market interactions that influence individual decision-making.\nThe framework's methodology could be extended to analyze broader policy scenarios. For instance, in healthcare policy design, the MLAB framework could simulate how different population segments might respond to insurance market reforms or public health initiatives. In educational policy, the framework could evaluate the effectiveness of various subsidy schemes across different socioeconomic groups."}]}

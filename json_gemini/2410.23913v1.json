We identify a property, which we call strong compositionality, that applies for many natural kinds of preference statement, and that allows a greedy algorithm for determining consistency of a set of preference statements. We also consider different natural definitions of optimality, and their relations to each other, for general preference languages based on lexicographic models. Based on our framework, we show that testing consistency, and thus inference, is polynomial for a specific preference language Lpqt, which allows strict and non-strict statements, comparisons between outcomes and between partial tuples, both ceteris paribus and strong statements, and their combination. Computing different kinds of optimal sets is also shown to be polynomial; this is backed up by our experimental results.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Preferences are considered in many different fields such as recommender systems and human-computer interaction [6, 18], databases [1, 12] and multi-objective decision making and social choice [2, 14, 17]. They are used to, e.g., find optimal decisions, solutions or items that satisfy the wishes or needs of a user or a group. In order to reason with preferences, typically assumptions are made on the form of the relation used to model the user preferences. In this paper we restrict our considerations to lexicographic models, and we consider preference inference, which involves reasoning about the the whole set of preference models that are consistent with the input preferences, as in [13, 20]; this contrasts with work that focuses on learning one lexicographic model that fits best with the given preferences [3, 5, 8, 24].\nPreference inference aims to overcome gaps of knowledge in the user preferences by analysing the given preferences and deciding whether another preference statement can be deduced. Since in this paper we allow negations of statements, preference inference can be reduced to testing consistency of a set of preference statements. We define a property, strong compositionality, that is satisfied by many natural types of preference statements and enables a simple greedy algorithm for testing consistency.\nFast computation is essential in many applications; we give a concrete instance Lpqt of a preference language that allows polynomial computation. This can represent a relatively expressive form of preference input. It can express preferences between a pair of complete assignments to a set of variables, and, more generally, between partial assignments to just a subset of the variables, allowing ceteris paribus assumptions or stronger implications on the values of other variables. We also allow non-strict statements, two forms of strict preference statements and can represent certain negated statements.\nPrevious work on preference inference based on standard lexicographic models have considered more restricted preference languages. Wilson [20] considered only non-negated non-strict statements, which can only express that one assignment is at least as good as another (or equivalent). Kohli and Jedidi [13] considers only non-negated strict statements, which can only express that one complete assignment is strictly better than another. In [21], preference statements are comparisons of complete assignments, and fixed value orders for the variables are given.\nOther work on preference inference includes that based on weighted sum models [23, 15], on hierarchical models [21], conditional lexicographic models [19]; Pareto orders [10], and"}, {"title": "Lex Models, Composition and Extension", "content": "In this section, we give some basic definitions; in particular, we define lexicographic models, along with a natural composition operation and extension relation, that are important in our approach. A lexicographic model has an associated ordering of (some of the) variables, along with value orderings for each such variable. This generates a (lexicographic) ordering relation, by first comparing outcomes a and \u1e9e on the first (i.e., most important) variable Y; only if a(Y) = \u03b2(Y) is the next most important variable considered.\nThroughout the paper we consider a fixed set V of n variables, where for each X \u2208 V, D(X) is the set of possible values of X. For subset of variables ACV let $\\mathbb{A} = \\prod_{X\\in A} D(X)$ be the set of possible assignments to A. For X \u2208 V, we abbreviate {X} to X (which is essentially D(X)). An outcome is an element of V, i.e., an assignment to all the variables. For outcome a and subset U of V, we define a(U) to be the tuple in $\\mathbb{U}$ generated by projecting (i.e., restricting) a to U. These definitions describe a decision scenario over a set of alternatives given by different features. Consider for example the choice between different flight connections. A set of variables to describe the flight connections could be V = {airline, time, class}. The variable domains are then given by D(airline) = airline = {KLM, LAN}, D(time) = {day, night} and D(class) = {economy, business}. Then projection of the outcome a = (KLM, day, economy) to the variables U = {airline, class} is given by a(U) = (KLM, economy).\nDefine G to be the set of lexicographic models (over the set of variables V); a lexicographic model or lex model, \u03c0 (over V), is defined to be a (possibly empty) sequence of the form (Y1, \u2265Y\u2081), ..., (Yk, \u2265Y\u2084), where Y\u00bf (i = 1, ..., k) are different variables in V, and each \u2265y, is a total order on Yi. The associated relation \u2265 \u2286 VX V is defined as follows: for outcomes a and \u03b2, \u03b1\u2265\u03c0\u03b2 if and only if either (i) for all i = 1,..., k, a(Y\u2081) = \u03b2(Y\u2081); or (ii) there exists i \u2208 {1,...,k} such that for all j < i, a(Yj) = \u03b2(Yj) and a(Yi) >Yv \u03b2(Yi) (i.e., \u03b1(Yi) \u2265Y; \u03b2(Yi) and a(Yi) \u2260 \u03b2(Y\u2081)). Thus \u2211 is a total pre-order on V, which is a total order if k = n = |V|.\nThe corresponding strict relation \u27a4 is given by \u03b1 \u03c0 \u03b2 if and only if there exists i \u2208 {1, ..., k} such that a(Yi) >Y (Y\u2081) and for all j < i, a(Yj) = \u03b2(Y;). The corresponding equivalence relation = is given by a = \u03b2 if and only if for all i = 1,...,k, a(Yi) = \u03b2(Yi). Thus, \u03b1=\u03c0\u03b2 if and only if a(V) = \u03b2(V), where V = {Y1,...,Yk} is set of the variables involved in \u03c0. Consider lexicographic models \u03c0 = (airline, KLM > LAN), (time, day > night) and \u03c0' = (class, economy > business), (time, night > day) for the previous example of flight connections. In the choice of airline decides which connection is preferred; only if these are the same, is the flight time considered. \u03c0' first compares the classes; only if these are the same, are the flight times considered. For outcomes a = (KLM, day, ec\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443), \u0412 = (KLM, night, business) and y = (LAN, day, economy) we have \u03b1\u03c0\u03b2>\u03c0\u03b3 and \u03b1 =\u03c0' \u03b3 \u03b5\u03c0' \u03b2.\nComposition of lexicographic models: We define an important composition operation on lex models, which can be shown to be associative. Let \u03c0 = (Y1, \u2265Y\u2081),\u2026\u2026., (Yk, \u2265Yk), and \u03c0' = (Z1, \u2265z\u2081),..., (Z1, \u2265z\u2081) be two lexicographic models. Let \u03c0\" be the sequence \u03c0' but where pairs (Zi, \u2265 z\u2081) are omitted if Zi \u2208 V. Define lex model \u03c0 \u03bf \u03c0' to be \u03c0 followed by \u03c0\". Note that $V_{\\pi \\circ \\pi'} = V_{\\pi} \\cup V_{\\pi'}$.\nLemma 1. \u25e6 is an associative operation on G.\nProof. For \u03c0,\u03c0' \u2208 G, we say that \u03c0 and \u03c0' are disjoint if V \u2229 V\u2032 = \u00d8. For set of variables U \u2286 V, define \u03c0\u2193\u2212U to be \u03c0 with all pairs of the form (X, \u2265x) omitted, when X \u2208 U\u2229 V. For any \u03c0,\u03c0' \u2208 G, we have that $\\pi \\circ \\pi' = \\pi \\circ (\\pi')^{+-V_{\\pi}}$, by definition.\nConsider any \u03c01, \u03c02, \u03c03 \u2208 G. For j = 1, 2, 3, let V; equal $V_{\\pi_j}$. Then, $(\\pi_1 \\circ \\pi_2) \\circ \\pi_3 = (\\pi_1 \\circ \\pi_2) \\circ \\pi'_3$, where $\\pi'_2 = (\\pi_2)^{+-V_1}$ and $\\pi'_3 = (\\pi_3)^{+-V_1\\cup V_2}$.\nAssociativity clearly holds for pairwise disjoint lexicographic models, so $(\\pi_1 \\circ \\pi_2) \\circ \\pi'_3 = \\pi_1 \\circ (\\pi'_2 \\circ \\pi'_3)$. Now, $\\pi_1 \\circ (\\pi_2 \\circ \\pi_3)$ equals $\\pi_1 \\circ (\\pi_2 \\circ \\pi_3)^{+-V_1}$, so, to prove associativity of it is sufficient to prove that $(\\pi_2 \\circ \\pi_3)^{+-V_1}$ equals $\\pi'_2 \\circ \\pi'_3$. We have that $(\\pi_2 \\circ \\pi_3)^{+-V_1}$ equals $(\\pi_2 \\circ (\\pi_3)^{+-V_2})^{+-V_1}$,"}, {"title": null, "content": "which equals $\\pi_2^{+-V_1} \\circ \\pi_3^{+-V_1\\cup V_2}$, i.e., $\\pi'_2 \\circ \\pi'_3$, completing the proof."}, {"title": null, "content": "Definition 1. For lex models \u03c0 and \u03c0' in G we say that \u03c0' extends \u03c0 if \u03c0' \u2260 \u03c0 and the sequence \u03c0' begins with \u03c0. We then write \u03c0' \u2203 \u03c0, and write \u03c0' \u2203 \u03c0 to mean that \u03c0' extends or equals \u03c0. This holds if and only if there exists a lex model \u03c0\" such that \u03c0' = \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\".\nLemma 2. For \u03c0,\u03c0' \u2208 G, we have \u03c0' \u2287 \u03c0 if and only if \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' = \u03c0'.\nProof. Suppose that \u03c0' extends or equals \u03c0, and write \u03c0' as \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\" where V\u3003\u2229 V\u03c0 = \u00d8. Then, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' = \u03c0\u03bf (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\") which equals \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0\" = \u03c0'. Conversely, suppose that \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' = \u03c0'. Let k = |V| and let \u03c0\" be the lexicographic model consisting of the first k pairs of \u03c0'. This equals the first k pairs of \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0', i.e., \u03c0, and thus, \u03c0' extends or equals \u03c0.\nThe composition of the two previously defined lex models is \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' = (airline, KLM > LAN),(time, day > night), (class, economy > business) and \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u2203 \u03c0.\nWe have the following basic monotonicity property.\nLemma 3. For \u03c0, \u03c0' \u2208 G, suppose that \u03c0' extends \u03c0. If \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2 then \u03b1\u03c0\u03b2. Also, if \u03b1 \u03c0 \u03b2 then \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2.\nProof. If \u03b1 >\u03c0 \u03b2 then a and \u03b2 differ on some variable in \u03c0, and a is better than \u1e9e on the first such variable; thus the same holds for \u03c0', since \u03c0' extends \u03c0, and so \u03b1 \u03a5\u03c0'\u03b2 holds. Similarly, if \u03b2 \u203a\u03c0\u03b1 then \u03b2 >\u03c0' \u03b1, which, using the fact that >\u3160 and >\u03c0' are both weak orders, is equivalent to: if \u03b1 \u03c0 \u03b2 then \u03b1 \u0395\u03c0' \u03b2, which thus implies: if \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2 then \u03b1\u03c0\u03b2. \u03bf\nThe result below is a key property of composition, which will be important later.\nLemma 4. Let \u03c0,\u03c0' \u2208 G. If \u03b1\u03c4\u03c0 \u03b2 and \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2 then \u03b1 \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2. If \u03b1\u03c4\u03c0\u03b2and\u03b1 \u2013\u03c0' \u03b2 then \u03b1 \u203a\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2 and \u03b1\u03c0'\u03bf\u03c0 \u03b2. Suppose now that \u03b1 =\u03c0 \u03b2. Then \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2 \u2190 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2; and \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2.\nProof. Since \u03c0'\u03bf\u03c0extends \u03c0', we have, by Lemma 3, that (i) \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2 implies \u03b1 \u2013\u03c0'\u03bf\u03c0 \u03b2. Similarly, (ii) if \u03b1 \u03c0 \u03b2 then \u03b1 \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2, and thus also a \u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2. We also have (iii) if \u03b1=\u03c0\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03c0' \u03b2 then \u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2. This is because a and \u1e9e differ on some variable in \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0', and the first such variable pair (X, \u2265) appears in \u03c0'; and X is the earliest variable in \u03c0' that a and \u1e9e differ on, so \u03b1 \u203a\u03c0' \u03b2 implies that a(X) > \u03b2(X) and thus, \u03b1 \u2013 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2.\nSuppose that a\u03b4\u03c0\u03b2and \u03b1\u03a5\u03c0' \u03b2.

So, we only need to deal with the case where \u03b1 \u039e\u03c0 \u03b2. Then \u03b1 \u2013 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c0' \u03b2 follows by (iii)."}, {"title": null, "content": "Suppose that a\u1f76\u03c0\u03b2and\u03b1\u03b4\u03c0' \u03b2.

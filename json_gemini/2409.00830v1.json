The main focus is on designing intelligent methods to derive ontology designs and capture all-encompassing knowledge about food, recipes, ingredients, cooking characteristics, and most importantly, nutrition, at scale. We present our ongoing work in this workshop paper, describe in some detail the relevant challenges in curating knowledge of Indian food, and propose our high-level ontology design. We also present a novel workflow that uses AI, LLM, and language technology to curate information from recipe blog sites in the public domain to build knowledge graphs for Indian food. The methods for knowledge curation proposed in this paper are generic and can be replicated for any domain. The design is application-agnostic and can be used for AI-driven smart analysis, building recommendation systems for Personalized Digital Health, and complementing the knowledge graph for Indian food with contextual information such as user information, food biochemistry, geographic information, agricultural information, etc.", "sections": [{"title": "1. Introduction", "content": "Food is playing an increasingly central role in health and sustainability discourses as the preservation of diverse cultures, food security, precision nutrition, personal and public health, agricultural practices, climate impact, and supply chains become focal points of discussion. However, any definitive effort in such a scientific pursuit requires well-founded applications to be designed around food and food-related data, with access to knowledge representation and reasoning systems for food. In this light, food knowledge graphs are crucial and reusable digital resources that can capture various nuances of food including but not limited to recipes, ingredients, flavor, texture, cooking techniques, cuisine, nutritional information, and mealtimes. They can be used for various applications like food recommendation, recipe recommendation, diet planning, health tracking, food quality control, managing food supply chains, and so on. While several countries including the US, parts of Europe (like Latvia, Norway, Spain, the UK, Italy, and Portugal), China, and Japan are working on building such knowledge bases for specific"}, {"title": "2. Related work", "content": "Several food knowledge graphs have been constructed based on these ontologies and their extensions, to support food computing applications. We mention only a few representative ones here. For a more comprehensive review of food ontology, food knowledge graphs, and food computing applications, one may refer to the works cited in [1, 2, 3]. In [3], authors have categorized existing food knowledge graphs into four different types - (1) knowledge graphs about recipes, (2) knowledge graphs about nutrients and health, (3) knowledge graphs about food safety, and (4) general food knowledge graphs. We follow the same pattern to group both ontology and knowledge graphs, though there exist many overlaps among the groups.\nThe first group of ontology mostly focuses on concepts of food related to recipes and cooking. Notable in this group are Table [4], Cooking ontology [5], BBC food ontology\u00b9, and so on. There are a few ontologies dedicated to special categories of food, like Open Food Facts\u00b2 that model information about packaged foods, Seafood ontology [6], and so on.\nRecipe knowledge graphs are built to store recipe entities that are extracted from crowd-sourced consumer review sites, recipe-sharing websites, and social media to primarily support food recommendation systems and build social networks around food. Foodbar knowledge graph [7] is one such system that extracts consumer opinions ratings etc. from different sources and augments this information with information about users, points of interest, cultural facts, and so on. RcpKG [8] is a multimodal and hierarchical food knowledge graph that curates information from popular recipe websites like Yummly and AllRecipes as well as semi-structured datasets like Recipe1M+ [9]. RcpKG also incorporates social relationships into the food knowledge graph for generating food recommendations that can take care of both personal preferences and social"}, {"title": "3. Unique and Complex Challenges in building FKG.in:\nSignificance and Relevance of Indian food", "content": "The diverse Indian cuisine reflects a history of over 8,000 years, during which the history of various ethnic groups and cultures have interacted with each other in the Indian subcontinent, resulting in a vast variety of cooking techniques, flavors, and regional cuisines. While this diversity has resulted in a rich repertoire of recipes, it has also introduced some unique challenges towards automating the task of building a food knowledge base. We note these and a few other challenges below:\n1. Lack of a comprehensive vocabulary of food items has necessitated that this work start from almost scratch. This spans all concepts related to food like ingredients, cuisines, styles, cooking processes, cookware, and so on. There exists a multiplicity of recipes with the same name but different compositions from different regions. To a large extent, this occurs due to regional variations in climate, culture, and availability of ingredients. The most common example of this is dal (lentil soup) which, though an integral part of almost all regional meals, has huge variations across the country. Additionally, as Indian food recipes are often quite complex, capturing the nuances of similar recipes is often a very difficult task.\n2. The multilingual nature of India poses a challenge exactly opposite to the previous one. The same food items have various vernacular names across the country. For example, haldi (Hindi), holud (Bengali), halad (Marathi), pasupu (Telugu) and manjal (Tamil), all refer to turmeric in different Indian languages. Building a common and inclusive dictionary of food items for India needs multilingual capabilities to address this diversity.\n3. Food homonyms present a challenge in the form of confusing granularities where ingredients and recipes may be known by the same name. A typical example is chawal (rice) which refers to both raw rice i.e. an ingredient and steamed rice i.e. the final dish.\n4. Another challenge stems from the fact that Indian food is not about precision cooking. Measurements are often expressed in terms of common kitchen containers like \"a cup\u201d or \u201ca katori (bowl)\u201d, for which there are no specific standards. Use of linguistic variables like \"a little\", \"some\", and \"a handful of\" are also encountered quite often.\n5. Socio-cultural association of food items with festivals, religious celebrations, and spiritual motivations is a worldwide phenomenon. These notions have to be captured to generate contextually relevant recommendations. For example, kheer or payasam (milk pudding), and Hyderabadi haleem are almost always associated with different religious celebrations, whereas abstinence food is typically expected to be without garlic or onion."}, {"title": "4. Proposed Ontology Design for Indian Food", "content": "We now present the details of FKG.in, the Indian Food Ontology, which is inspired by FoodOn [14] and FoodKG [15], and wherever needed, adapted them to suit the Indian context. FKG.in attempts to capture important properties of Indian food in terms of culinary language, cooking variations, and precision nutrition. In doing so, we have also attempted to make the ontology modular and flexible to incorporate changes in the knowledge curation stage if required.\nFigure 1 presents the proposed ontology design. Food is an abstract superclass and Ingredients and Recipes are its most important subclasses. These two concepts are described in more"}, {"title": "5. Knowledge Curation Workflow for building FKG.in", "content": "Figure 2 presents the core tasks of the AI-driven semi-automated workflow for building a food knowledge graph using structured and unstructured information curated from multiple websites. The details of each task are presented in this section.\n\n\u2022 Task 1 - Creation of Foundational Ontology An instance of the foundational ontology for Indian food is created using Web Ontology Language (OWL) in the RDF/XML format by extending reliable and recognized ontologies and dictionaries. Detailed hierarchical designs for storing the labels of cuisines, diet labels, mealtimes, cooking characteristics, etc. described earlier have also been created in the form of a dictionary. Initial vocabulary for each of these structures was populated using various sources like Wikipedia, digitized books [25], FoodKG [15], Indian Food Composition Table [23], and other sources for Indian food [22], though the vocabulary itself is not restricted to Indian food alone. The vocabulary was further augmented using large language models. For example, a list of bulb or stem vegetables commonly found in India was generated using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and added to the list of ingredients. The initialization step is a one-time process that involves careful manual curation with several sanity checks. The vocabulary is also updated periodically as explained later. We are using the SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) W3C recommendation to represent and organize the structured controlled vocabulary as the principal element categories of SKOS such as concepts, labels, notations, documentation, semantic relations, mapping properties, and collections suit the needs of storing food, culinary and nutritional knowledge quite well.\n\u2022 Task 2 - Crawling of Recipe Blogs: We have identified 40 recipe blogs and websites with rich information about Indian food recipes, their nutritional information, and other culinary information. To begin with, we have crawled 5 recipe blogs viz. archanask-itchen, hookedonheat, indianhealthyrecipes, masalakorb and vegrecipesofindia, each of which has several recipe websites along with a detailed recipe card for each. The crawler gathers content from each recipe blog page and stores it locally as an HTML file along with metadata like its source URL, recipe name, recipe category, blogpost timestamp, and scraping timestamp for reproducibility and parsing.\n\u2022 Task 3 - LLM-augmented Information Extraction: The HTML files are then cleaned and parsed to extract the recipe details such as ingredients, cooking characteristics, nutritional information, etc. from both structured and unstructured parts. This was done by setting up a pipeline using Langchain and GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model, to process the recipe webpage content and generate semi-structured output using zero-shot and few-shot prompts. GPT 3.5 is also employed to translate Indian ingredient names, written in Indian or Roman scripts to their English names. This helps in entity resolution and consolidation later while populating the knowledge graph after the soundness check. This process is executed for all the recipe URLs before moving on to the next steps.\n\u2022 Task 4 - Soundness Assessment of Information: After generating food entities and relations from each recipe, this step runs automated checks to validate the information against existing vocabularies, performs entity resolution and then flags possible inconsistencies to humans for correction. This step is to ensure that the information added to the knowledge base is correct.\n\n\u2022 Task 4.2 - All inconsistencies identified in the earlier step are presented to human curators for validation and correction if needed. For example, a common mistake made by language tools, including LLMs, is the failure to detect multi-word named entities correctly. For example, for a recipe to make \"pudina chutney sandwich\", the key ingredient is \"pudina chutney\" and not \u201cpudina\u201d which is a basic ingredient. A human can correct the entity and help in appropriate incorporation of \u201cPudina chutney\" as an ingredient, which is also a recipe, and may appear as such in other recipes also. Several instances of incorrect and incomplete information extraction are observed for unstructured portions.\nAn easy-to-use interface has been built to aid the correction process. As expected, the number of entities that need human intervention, go down. Further, insights obtained from human intervention were used to improve the LLM prompts, which also helped reduce the error of the extraction process. Human feedback is also used to augment the ontology in an atomic, reliable, and consistent manner to accommodate new information obtained from the recipe web pages.\nThe above methods ensure the soundness of the knowledge graph, i.e. information added to the knowledge base is correct. It however does not ensure completeness of information in situations where the large language model fails to extract a piece of information altogether. Such issues will be addressed in the future while working on the completeness of the knowledge graph for Indian food.\n\u2022 Task 5 - FKG.in Ingestion and Maintenance: The verified and validated information components are ingested into the knowledge graph. While some of them may result in vocabulary extensions, some are added as instances of classes and relationships.\nThe algorithmic details of the knowledge curation workflow are presented below:\n1. Initialization: Make a list of target information to be extracted from recipe URLs based on the data/class properties associated with ingredients and recipes as per the ontology.\n2. Crawling and Extraction: Fetch and store the recipe dump locally for all the recipe URLs. Use the requests library in Python to parse and extract target information from the recipe card and store it in an XML file.\n3. Semantic Resolution: Use semantic resolution to map property names across recipe domains. For example, recipe blogs may use the term region or style to refer to cuisine. While the dataset is curated mostly with manual intervention in the initial phases, the lists of property names and values are automated and learned over time."}, {"title": "6. Current Status of FKG.in", "content": "The size of FKG.in is presently around 50 MB. It has information about 9628 unique recipe instances gathered from the five recipe blogs mentioned earlier. After consolidating the metadata, these recipes belong to 39 distinct categories such as breakfast, cakes, vegetarian, Hyderabadi, Indian sweets, etc. The total number of ingredient nodes in the knowledge graph is currently 38819. We have observed some nodes have Hindi names in Devanagari fonts, indicating that more resolution rules will need to be added to address code-mixing. It has"}, {"title": "7. Conclusions and Future Work", "content": "In this paper, we have presented the work initiated towards building FKG.in. Due to the lack of reference resources, almost everything had to be initiated from scratch. Unlike earlier methods, which have focused on building knowledge graphs from semi-structured data and in application-specific ways, our focus is on using AI-enabled methods for extracting relevant information from all kinds of recipe blogs to populate the knowledge graph. Zero-shot and few-shot methods that exploit the large language model GPT-3.5 Turbo have been used extensively to build initial vocabularies and subsequently to extract entities and relations to populate the knowledge base. Methods to ensure soundness of information are also incorporated into the pipeline. We have presented the current status of the knowledge graph called FKG.in.\nFurther work on the refinement of ontology design as well as on knowledge engineering techniques is underway. NLP tools for multilingual semantic reasoning are one of the primary areas identified for future research. Another area of focus is on quantitative assessments of the soundness and completeness of the knowledge graph.\nIn the future, we expect work to spread across many other directions that involve reasoning over Indian food concepts as well. Such knowledge graphs can address several questions of historical, social, and cultural aspects of food and food habits, enable several applications including but not limited to food recommendation systems, personal health navigation systems, recipe generation, and recipe recommendation systems, and also aid knowledge discovery from"}]}

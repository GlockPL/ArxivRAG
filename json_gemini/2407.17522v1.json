INTRODUCTION", "content": "The future appears to be dominated by Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). Technology\nparticularly AI\nexemplifies anticipation and uncertainty by replicat-\ning human intelligence. To the extent that we con-\ncern ourselves with the future, we oscillate between\nhope and anxiety. Hope and anxiety are recognised\nas uncertainty emotions (Gordon, 1969, 1987). On\nthe other hand, broader anticipatory emotions in-\nclude hope, trust, fear, and anxiety (Castelfranchi\nand Miceli, 2011; Feil et al., 2022).\nAnticipation plays a critical role in decision-making\nand behaviour (Moore and Hoffman, 2011; Graben-\nhorst et al., 2021) as the desire to reduce uncertainty\nis a potent motivator of social behaviour (Hirsh et al.,\n2012), as people constantly seek to estimate and re-\nduce uncertainties in social interactions to enhance\ntheir productivity, well-being, and ultimately their\nsurvival as social beings (FeldmanHall and Shenhav,\n2019). The ability to navigate and adapt to uncertain\nfutures becomes crucial.\nThe discourse on social media is replete with en-\nvisaged future scenarios. These scenarios serve as a\nroadmap for users, guiding their expectations and in-\nforming their actions (Koivunen et al., 2023; Tavory\nand Eliasoph, 2013). Influencers play a significant\nrole in shaping public perceptions and the narrative\nsurrounding these uncertainties (Acerbi, 2022, 2019;\nJin and Phua, 2014; Landowska et al., 2023; Spry\net al., 2011; Tur et al., 2022). For instance, their an-\nticipation of AI and automation, while often seen as\nprogress, also brings up concerns about job loss, pri-\nvacy, and tech power concentration. This study not\nonly uncover the anticipatory discourse on the X plat-\nform but also scrutinizes the power dynamics in tech\ndiscourse, particularly the impact of key opinion lead-\ners (KOLs) in moulding public views of tech futures.\nBased on a corpus of anticipatory discourse Table 1)\nfrom Twitter spanning 2021 to 2023, this study inte-\ngrates BERTopic modelling, sentiment, and emotion\nanalyses to explore the futures represented by tech-\nnology influencers on social media and to assess the\nemotional impact of these anticipated visions articu-\nlated to the public audiences.\nResearch on how individuals anticipate and struc-\nture future events has been central in social theory,\ne.g., (Adam, 1990; Bergmann, 1992; Emirbayer and\nMische, 1998; Abbott, 2001; Mische, 2009). Every\nhuman interaction inherently involves a connection\nto future events Tavory and Eliasoph (2013). When\nindividuals engage with each other, they orient them-\nselves towards future circumstances, and consequently\nit becomes imperative for individuals to simultane-\nously navigate the inherent uncertainties associated\nwith these future-oriented interactions (ibid., p. 909).\nBy employing a triangulated methodological ap-\nproach (e.g., (Egbert and Baker, 2019), we aim to\nintegrate three distinct methods for discourse anal-\nsis of a tweet-based corpus: BERTopic modelling\n(contextual corpus analysis), Keywords analysis (non-\ncontextual corpus analysis), and lexicon-based analy-\nsis (sentiment, emotion, attitude analyses). Our goal\nis to identify the leading technologies and KOLs, how\ntechnological topics (anticipated futures) evolve and\ninterrelate over time, and the sentiments, anticipatory\nemotions, and attitudes associated with them within"}, {"title": "2. LITERATURE REVIEW", "content": "Anticipating (Abstract or Concrete) Futures.\nWe recognise two main categories of the future: a.\n'present futures' (Luhmann, 1982) are 'pre-given fu-\ntures' rooted in the past, i.e., lived ones (Adam and\nGroves, 2011); and b. 'future present' (Luhmann,\n1982) are 'futures-in-the-making' that are possibly\nlatent, growing, and changing ones, i.e., living ones\n(Adam and Groves, 2011). The 'present future' refers\nto the concrete, i.e. practical, presentational, explicit,\n(Poli, 2017, 2014) and it is the contextual, embodied,\nand embedded future (Adam and Groves, 2007); and\nthe 'future present' refers to the abstract (symbolic,\nrepresentational, implicit) future that lacks context\nand content, creating an opportunity for exploration\nand processing (Adam and Groves, 2007). 'Present\nfutures' are linear continuations of the past in the\npresent (Poli, 2014), which shape the future by present\nmeans (Adam and Groves, 2007; Miller, 2007). The\nvalue of these closed-type futures is calculated against\nits alternatives (forecasts) and traded as commodities\n(Adam and Groves, 2007); the future with the high-\nest value is the one with the largest profit. Because of\nthe optimistic or pessimistic character of their trans-\nformed or reinterpreted visions, they serve as pro-\njections aiming at evoking hope or fear (Luhmann,\n1982).\n'Future presents' are latent, but they can be recog-\nnised and foreseen, thus impacting the present by en-\ntering into it and being used in the present (Adam\nand Groves, 2011). These futures are conceptualised,\nisolated from their contexts, and technologically prej-\nudiced (Luhmann, 1982), which makes them limitless\npossibilities, leading to high uncertainty (Adam and\nGroves, 2007; Beckert, 2013; Poli, 2014, 2017). These\nabstract futures are open-type futures with abstract\nvalues that are freely traded on the assumption that\nthey can be computed at any location and at any\ntime, and it may be used for any situation (Adam\nand Groves, 2007). The 'future presents' are unpre-\ndictable and evoke fictional expectations based on the\n\"as if\" rule (Beckert, 2013). Future presents seems\nto be anticipatory in their character because of their\n'use-of-the-future' orientation (Poli, 2017).\nAnticipatory Emotions. Anticipation plays a\ncrucial role in the generation of emotions, and the\nliterature distinguishes between future-oriented emo-\ntions for anticipatory and anticipated experiences. An-\nticipatory emotions encompass present feelings related\nto an upcoming event (Bagozzi et al., 1998; Baum-\ngartner et al., 2008; Feil et al., 2022), whereas an-\nticipated emotions pertain to the expected emotional\nresponses a person may have when faced with a future\noccurrence (Baumgartner et al., 2008; Feil et al., 2022;\nPerugini and Bagozzi, 2001). Anticipatory emotions\nprimarily manifest as prospective feelings of hope and\nfear and anticipated emotions tend to be retrospec-\ntive, including sensations like relief, satisfaction, dis-\nappointment, and anger (Baumgartner et al., 2008;\nFeil et al., 2022). Hope responds to possible future\noutcomes, while fear is associated with negative ones\n(Castelfranchi and Miceli, 2011; MacLeod, 2017; Vazard,\n2024). Unmet hope is leading to disappointment,\nwhereas the absence of a feared event brings relief\n(Baumgartner et al., 2008; Mowrer, 1960).\nMoreover, (Plutchik, 1980) identifies anticipation\nas one of the eight primary bipolar emotions. At pri-\nmary dyads, it interacts with joy to create optimism,\nand with anger to result in aggressiveness (Plutchik,\n2001). Secondary dyads, two petals apart, pair antic-\nipation with trust, leading to hope, and with disgust,"}, {"title": "3. DATA AND METHODS", "content": "Data Collection. The dataset was collected us-\ning the scraping library snsscrape (Just AnotherAr-\nchivist, 2023). Tweets were sourced from about 400\ntechnology influencers' feeds published in the time-\nframe from January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2023. The\nselection of KOLs was meticulously carried out by our\nteam of experts. Table 2 provides a comprehensive\noverview of the size and diversity of our dataset.\nData Cleaning. To ensure the accuracy of this\nanalysis, we preprocessed the tweets by removing URLs,\nemails, and user handles, which are identifiers for X\nusers.\nData Analysis. We employed a comprehensive\nsuite of Natural Language Processing techniques to\nconduct an in-depth analysis of the data we collected.\nAppropriate non-parametric statistical tests were used\nto assess significance of findings.\nContextual Corpus Analysis. Following prior work\non extracting topics from Twitter data (Bogdanow-\nicz and Guan, 2022; Egger and Yu, 2022; Landowska\net al., 2023; Yang and Saffer, 2021), we trained the\nstate-of-the-art BERTopic model implemented in the\nBERTopic library (Grootendorst, 2022). As the de-\nfault setting of BERTopic is vulnerable on data vol-\nume, to perform analysis efficiently, we used an online\nimplementation of the algorithm using: Incremen-\ntalPCA dimensionality reduction model, MiniBatchK-\nMeans clustering algorithm and a OnlineCount Vec-\ntorizer vectorisation scheme, with an all-MiniLM-L6-\nv2 embeddings base applied to raw tweets. BERTopic\nanalysed the dataset and categorised it into 100 con-\ntextually coherent, distinct topics. We visualised the\ntopics using the method of (Sievert and Shirley, 2014),\nimplemented in the library pyLDAvis (Mabey, 2021).\nNon-contextual Corpus Analysis. Our analysis of\nthe non-contextual corpus consists of identifying KOLs\nand keywords. KOLs in tech discussions were iden-\ntified based on their tweet volume on the X plat-\nform (Casal\u00f3 et al., 2020). Indicating keywords re-\nquired utilising a compact English model from the\nSpacy\u00b9 package. This model analyses the given cor-\npus, assigning respective metadata to each sentence\nand word, ultimately generating an annotated corpus.\nThe textual data underwent processing through lem-\nmatisation and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. The\nlemmatised form of any word serves as a keyword, ex-\ncluding stop words. Subsequently, we computed the\nglobal attributes of the corpus, including the most\ndistinctive keywords.\nSentiment and Emotions Analysis. To analyse sen-\ntiment, we leveraged the Brand24 model (Augusty-\nniak et al., 2023; Rajda et al., 2022). This recent\nmodel is based on a fine-tuned multilingual LLM and\nis specifically tailored for analysing social media data.\nThe Brand24 sentiment classifier operates in a three\npolarities (positive, negative, and neutral). The aver-\nage sentiment score was defined as follows:\n(1)\n$Score = \\frac{N+ - N-}{N-+ N\u00b0 + N+}$,\nwhere N, N\u00b0 and N+ denote the number of tweets\nclassified as positive, neutral, and negative, respec-\ntively. For analysing emotions, we chose to adopt the\nenhanced and expanded model introduced by (Mo-\nhammad et al., 2018), which is accessible as a func-\ntional framework shared by (Camacho-Collados et al.,\n2022). We utilised the official implementation avail-\nable from the HuggingFace repository\u00b2. The model\nclassifies emotions in a multi-label schema, meaning\nthat each text is assigned a separate score for each\nof the 11 emotions (sadness, disgust, anger, fear, an-\nticipation, surprise, joy, love, trust, pessimism, opti-\nmism). Pessimism and optimism scores were rejected.\nFollowing Plutchik Plutchik (1980), to define scores of\nhope and anxiety, for each topic, we paired anticipa-\ntion with trust to obtain hope scores, while also link-\ning anticipation with fear, resulting in anxiety (please\nrefer to Equation (1)).\n(2)\n$Score(Anxiety) = Score (Anticipation) + Score(Fear)$\n$Score(Hope) = Score (Anticipation) + Score(Trust)$,\nand the topics are scored by averaging, respec-\ntively. We incorporated an emotion colour palette\ninspired by Plutchik's wheel of emotions from (Semer-\naro et al., 2021). This visually enhanced our findings\nand provide a more intuitive representation of emo-\ntional states. Despite the frequent use of the terms\noptimism and pessimism, there is a noticeable lack of\nconsensus on their precise definitions. In this study,\nwe propose a coherent approach by interpreting them"}, {"title": "4. RESULTS", "content": "4.1. Technology-Driven Topics. Distinct Topics.\nAfter several rounds of training the BERTopic model,\nwe determined that the optimal number of distinct\ntopics was 100. Each topic is linked to a specific set of\ntweets, enabling a deeper understanding of the princi-\npal themes within the dataset. For a comprehensive\nlist of all topics (please refer to the supplementary\nrepository). The Coherence Value measure (please\nsee (R\u00f6der et al., 2015)) for 25 topics is about 66%,\ndemonstrating that topics are of high-quality (as ev-\nidenced by other studies on Twitter/X data, under\nthis metric, BERTopic rarely achieves scores higher\nthan 70% (Campagnolo et al., 2022; Santakij et al.,\n2024; Austin et al., 2024) unless for small and coher-\nent corpora (Chen et al., 2023)).\nHierarchical Clustering. BERTopic model also\ngenerated 21 unique clusters from 100 topics (please\nrefer to Table 3). The relationships between the doc-\numents and these themes are elucidated, as depicted\nin the hierarchical clustering dendrogram (please refer\nto Figure 1). These groups show how different tech\nthemes like AI, ML, and Data Science are influenc-\ning each other as they develop within the discussing\ncommunity. The dendrogram illustrates how topics\nare related to each other based on their distance in\nthe high-dimensional space, where topics are closer if\nthey are more similar (please refer to Intertopic Dis-\ntance Map in the supplementary repository).\nEngagement in discussions on futures. The\nrange of tweet counts across topics is 23,144 tweets\n(from 7,633 to 30,777). The average engagement of\ndiscussion (the mean count of tweets per topic) is\n14,580 tweets. Approximately 41.75% of the top-\nics exceed this mean count. After excluding non-\ntechnology related discussions like 'Time Reflections'\nor 'Gratitude,' the top 5 tech-driven topics include\nTopic 25 (27,231 tweets), Topic 0 (27,103 tweets),\nTopic 83 (22,485 tweets), Topic 6 (21,827 tweets), and\nTopic 46 (21,635 tweets). These topics are discussed\nsignificantly more frequently than the bottom 5 be-\nlow the median, such as Topic 70 (7,633 tweets), Topic\n99 (8,418 tweets), Topic 68 (8,430 tweets), Topic 79\n(8,792 tweets), and Topic 14 (9,096 tweets).\nFutures Evolution.

KOLs like Jamesvgingerich, digi-\ntal_trans4m, and kirkdborne shape discourse in fields\nsuch as 'Climate Change' and 'Robotics.' They foster\ncommunities and gain recognition in distinct subjects\n(Furini, 2024; Haupt, 2021; Lichti et al., 2023). They\nnot only establish an influential 'anticipatory news\ninfrastructure' (Ananny and Finn, 2020), but also\nenhance their tweets and foster societal approval for\nnew technologies by integrating anticipatory emotions\ninto the formation of futures (Valente and Pumpuang,\n2007). The discourse power concentration among few\ninfluencers highlights their central role in content cre-\nation and dissemination (Martin and Sharma, 2022;\nOueslati et al., 2023). A few voices significantly shape\npublic perceptions of technological futures, what raises\nquestions about the diversity and inclusivity of the\ntech discourse.\n5.3. Positive Sentiment, Hope, and Optimism\nTowards Anticipated Futures. Most of the dis-\ncourse remained neutral, indicating that influencers\ntended to provide informative yet potentially ambigu-\nous information (e.g., 'Machine Learning,' 'Deep Learn-\ning,' 'Climate Change,' 'Disruptive TV/Video,' 'AI,'\nReferring strictly to anticipatory emotions, 'Hope'\nprevails over 'Anxiety' throughout the corpus. Top-\nics with the highest 'Hope' scores include 'Leader-\nship of Change,' 'Change Management,' 'CIO,' 'Busi-\nness,' 'Future of Work,' 'Agile,' 'Customer,' 'CX,'\n'Customer Experience,' 'Employees,' 'Manufacturing,'\n'Agtech,' 'Sustainability,' 'Innovation,' and 'Leader-\nship, Leaders, Kate Nasser.' 'Trust' fosters 'Hope'\n(Pleeging et al., 2022, 2021). Hope is inherently tied\nto anticipation, fostering a forward-looking perspec-\ntive that helps individuals manage present challenges\nby focusing on potential future successes (TenHouten,\n2023). This combination can drive proactive behaviour\nand resilience in the face of adversity (Pleeging et al.,\n2021). Conversely, lower 'Hope' scores in topics such\nas 'People Skills Chat,' 'People, Work RT,' 'Climate\nChange,' 'Education, Future Economy,' 'Remote Work,\nFuture of Work,' and 'Digital, Transformation, Busi-\nness, Future' suggest that these areas are perceived\nwith more uncertainty or challenges. This reflects\nconcerns about current issues and future outcomes,\nhighlighting the perceived difficulties and risks as-\nsociated with these topics. For instance, the ambi-\nguity surrounding climate change's economic conse-\nquences contributes to a pervasive sense of uncer-\ntainty (Cerreia-Vioglio et al., 2022). Additionally,\neconomic policy uncertainty related to environmen-\ntal regulations can lower hope and increase anxiety\nabout future outcomes (Barnett et al., 2022).\nTopics with the highest 'Anxiety' scores include\n'CIO, Business, Future of Work, Agile,' 'Manufac-\nturing, Agtech, Sustainability, Innovation,' 'CX, Cus-\ntomer, Customer Experience, Experience,' 'Quantum\nComputing,' and 'Innovation, Engineering, Energy\nTechnology.' In contrast, topics with the lowest 'Anx-\niety' scores encompass 'Leadership of Change, Change\nManagement,' 'People Skills Chat, People, Work RT,'\n'Customer, CX, Customer Experience, Employees,\u2019\n'Leadership, Leaders, Kate Nasser, Future of Work,'\nand 'Climate Change.' The expectations related to\nthese topics, as set by KOLs, introduce 'Fear,' which\nis a response triggered by the appraisal of imminent\ndanger (Kurth, 2015, 2018). This 'Fear' can subse-\nquently activate preparatory behaviours for an antic-\nipated future (Castelfranchi and Miceli, 2011). Addi-\ntionally, it is linked with 'Anticipation' (together in-\nducing 'Anxiety') related to the uncertainty surround-\ning certain threats (Kurth, 2015, 2018), particularly\nthe ambiguity regarding their occurrence (Liu et al.,\n2024; Vazard, 2024).\nDominant KOLs' 'Optimism' might impact follow-\ners' views on tech's potential, reflecting a trend to-\nwards techno-optimism (K\u00f6nigs, 2022). Although there"}, {"title": "6. CONCLUSION", "content": "Incorporating topic modelling, sentiment, and emo-\ntion analyses into the context of discourse analysis\nof 1.5 million tweets allowed us to discover anticipa-\ntory discussions on technological futures introduced\nby KOLs to a public audience. The most talked-\nabout topics on X were 'ML/Data Science/DL/AI,'\n'Disruptive TV/Video,' 'IoT,' 'Climate Change,' and\n'War in Ukraine.' The results underscore the pro-\nfound influence of KOLs in shaping these discussions.\nIntegrated into discourse analysis, we find that tech-\nnological discourse is inherently anticipatory, with KOLs\nsetting a hopeful emotional tone. The high pres-\nence of 'Anticipation' combined with 'Trust' results\nin 'Hope,' while combined with 'Fear,' it leads to\n'Anxiety.' Clearly, KOLs propagate 'Hope' rather\nthan 'Anxiety.' This often overlooks potential fu-\nture threats from technological uncertainty and fos-\nters users' anticipation of a positive technological fu-\nture. The high presence of 'Anticipation' coupled\nwith 'Joy' leads to 'Optimism,' whereas paired with\n'Sadness,' it results in 'Pessimism.' KOLs empha-\nsise 'Optimism' and its associated technological ad-\nvantages, favouring it over 'Pessimism' and its tech-\nnological challenges.\nThis study contributes to understanding the mean-\ning of anticipatory discourse and its use in influencing\npublic expectations and behaviours. It underscores\nthe significant role of KOLs in guiding societal re-\nsponses to technological advancements and shows how\ntechno-optimism is propagated in public discourse about\nfuture technologies. Moreover, this study advances\nmeasure pessimism, as increased anticipation is as-\nsociated with decreased sadness. Finally, given the\nvery weak correlation between anticipation and joy,\nthis combination may not be as effective for measur-\ning optimism. It is worth considering other combina-\ntions or additional factors to measure optimism more\naccurately. From a practical standpoint, this study\nunderscores the potential of integrating anticipatory\ndiscourse into AI simulations. Doing so enhances our\nability to prepare for and navigate future uncertain-\nties, making it a critical tool for various fields striving\nto stay ahead of the curve. This method can com-\nplement traditional forecasting and scenario planning\ntechniques, offering a more comprehensive toolkit for\nanticipating future developments.\nIt is important to acknowledge limitations of our\nfindings. Firstly, the analysis was limited to a selected\ngroup of technology influencers, which may not cap-\nture the full spectrum of opinions on future technolo-\ngies, thus affecting the generalisability of our conclu-\nsions. Additionally, we focused solely on tweets, ex-\ncluding replies and comments that could offer deeper\ninsights into public perceptions. Secondly, our key-\nword analysis disregarded context and domain, fac-\ntors that significantly influence word meanings and\nprecision. Thirdly, while this study provides valuable\ninsights into the correlations between emotions, the\nweak correlation between anticipation and joy sug-\ngests that this combination may not be effective for\nmeasuring optimism. Future research should explore\nother combinations or additional factors to measure\noptimism more accurately. Additionally, the relation-\nship between anticipation and fear, though usable for\nmeasuring anxiety, is relatively weak and may benefit\nfrom further investigation. Future research should in-\nclude comparative studies with other media sources,\nconduct longitudinal studies to track discourse evolu-\ntion, and refine quantitative methods by incorporat-\ning additional data and developing more sophisticated\nmodels to capture nuances in anticipatory discourse."}, {"title": "7.

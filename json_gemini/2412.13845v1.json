Their ability to understand and generate human-\nlike language has enabled groundbreaking applications, from machine translation to image and video captioning [82]. More recently, the integration of LLMs into video processing has sparked significant\ninterest, leading to advances in tasks such as action recognition [176, 177], anomaly detection [159, 201, 212], and video summarization [73, 103, 192, 213]. However, videos pose unique challenges\ncompared to other modalities due to their dual reliance on both spatial and temporal information [21]. Unlike static images, videos\ncapture the dimension of time, embedding sequential dynamics that demand sophisticated reasoning [100, 148]. Similarly, unlike tex-\ntual data, videos involve rich, complex visual elements that require intricate modeling [26, 169].\nDespite these advancements, a fundamental question remains unresolved: Do language models truly understand the concept of\ntime? Temporal reasoning, the ability to comprehend and infer"}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "The application of LLMs to video processing has attracted significant attention, owing to their capacity to bridge visual and textual\nmodalities [172]. In this section, we review related work across\nfour key areas: LLMs for video understanding, pretrained visual\nencoders, datasets for video understanding, and temporal reasoning\nin Al systems. We also highlight the distinct contributions of our\nwork compared to prior studies.\nLLMs for video understanding. LLMs have demonstrated re-markable versatility in video-related tasks by incorporating multi-modal learning frameworks [183]. Notable works, such as Flamingo\n[5] by DeepMind, integrate visual and textual modalities for tasks\nlike video captioning and video question answering (QA). Flamingo\nuses a cross-modal attention mechanism to align spatiotemporal\nvideo embeddings with text representations, showcasing the poten-tial of LLMs in multimodal fusion. Other models [54, 56, 152, 196], including OmniVL [152] and Florence [196], explore unified ar-chitectures that handle images, videos, and text simultaneously,\nreducing reliance on domain-specific encoders [83, 160-168]. How-ever, these works primarily focus on improving task performance\nwithout a deep analysis of how LLMs handle temporal dynamics,\nleaving their capacity for explicit time reasoning largely unexam-ined.\nWhile prior studies [7, 42, 63, 75, 140, 153] primarily emphasize\ntask performance, we specifically investigate whether LLMs truly understand the concept of time. Our work explores the interplay be-tween spatiotemporal embeddings and LLM frameworks, providing\na deeper analysis of their temporal reasoning capabilities.\nPretrained visual encoders in multimodal learning. The\nsuccess of LLMs in video understanding often hinges on the use of\npretrained visual encoders [31, 50, 98, 173]. Models like CLIP [121],\nResNet [67], and Vision Transformers (ViT) [44] are frequently\nused for spatial feature extraction, while video-specific encoders\nsuch as I3D [18], SlowFast [47], TimeSformer [9], and Video Swin\nTransformer [108] extract spatiotemporal features. These encoders\nare trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet [40, 126] and\nKinetics [16, 17, 81], enabling them to capture fine-grained features\nfor downstream tasks. While the modularity of these encoders facilitates efficient\nsystem design, their reliance on general-purpose pretrained features\nposes limitations, particularly in domain-specific tasks and long-term temporal reasoning [83, 120, 160, 164, 165, 168]. Existing works\noften treat encoders as static components, overlooking the potential\nbenefits of jointly optimizing encoders and LLMs for temporal\nunderstanding [132, 150].\nUnlike works that use pretrained encoders as black-box com-ponents [133], we examine their limitations, including their bias\ntoward short-term dependencies and their challenges in generaliz-ing to abstract temporal concepts. We propose pathways for jointly\noptimizing encoders and LLMs to address these issues.\nDatasets for video understanding. Datasets are fundamental\nto advancing video understanding, particularly for assessing the\ntemporal reasoning abilities of LLMs [55, 76, 209]. Current datasets\noften focus on action recognition, video captioning, or question-answering, capturing spatiotemporal patterns and semantic connec-\ntions [57, 77, 127]. However, many datasets emphasize short-term motions or provide only surface-level annotations, lacking temporal\ndetails such as event order, causality, or duration [81, 87, 136, 174].\nWhile multimodal datasets, combining video with text or audio,\noffer opportunities for LLMs to align spatiotemporal and seman-tic reasoning, challenges remain [48, 154]. These include limited\ndiversity in scenarios, imprecise annotations, and the difficulty of\nrepresenting long-term dependencies [156, 212]. To truly evalu-ate and enhance LLMs' temporal understanding, future datasets\nmust provide richer, more diverse temporal annotations and ro-bust benchmarks across varied domains [118]."}, {"title": "3 Analysis and Discussion", "content": "Can LLMs understand the concept of time? LLMs exhibit several strengths in processing temporal information. Trained on tex-tual data containing narrations or instructions, they can infer tem-poral relationships through contextual cues such as \"first\", \"then\",\nand \"after\". When paired with video encoders, LLMs can process\nspatiotemporal embeddings, enabling tasks like action recognition\nand temporal event ordering.\nHowever, LLMs lack direct temporal awareness. Standard models\ndo not inherently model the flow of time unless explicitly trained\non sequential video data. Instead, they rely on external encoders\nto provide temporal structure. Capturing long-term dependencies\nover extended video sequences is another challenge, as LLMs of-ten operate on tokenized inputs within limited context windows.\nAdditionally, video encoders like 3D CNNs [18, 146] or video trans-formers [119, 157], which act as the \"eyes\" of the system, may excel\nin capturing motion patterns but struggle to generalize abstract\ntemporal concepts like causality or duration.\nA significant limitation lies in the representation of visual time.\nUnlike textual representations, visual cues require explicit modeling\nof motion and event transitions. This ambiguity underscores the\nneed for improved temporal modeling in both encoders and LLMs.\nLLMs applied to videos using pretrained visual encoders.\nMost existing approaches use pretrained image or video encoders\nto extract visual or spatiotemporal information, rather than de-signing entirely new encoders . Pretrained image\nencoders such as CLIP [121], ResNet [67], and ViT [147] excel in\ncapturing spatial information, while video encoders like I3D [18],\nSlowFast [47], TimeSformer [9], and Video Swin Transformer [108]\nare widely used for spatiotemporal feature extraction. These en-\ncoders, trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet [40, 126]\nor Kinetics [17, 18, 81], are adept at learning rich feature representa-tions, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks [21, 26, 43, 83,\n156, 160, 164, 165, 168, 169, 212]. Notably, video encoders incorpo-rate mechanisms to model temporal dependencies, such as optical"}, {"title": "4 Future Directions", "content": "Building on the preceding analysis and discussion, we outline below\nseveral promising future research directions for those interested in\nadvancing video LLMs.\nOvercoming dataset challenges for LLMs. Datasets remain a\ncritical bottleneck in advancing LLM-based video systems. Address-ing their limitations requires both creative solutions and resource\ninvestments:\ni. Temporal annotations and structure: Enriching datasets with\ntemporal annotations, such as event order, duration, and causal\nrelationships, is essential. Techniques like crowd-sourced annotations, AI-assisted labeling, or synthetic data generation\ncould address the scarcity of such datasets.\nii. Balancing scale and quality: While large-scale datasets like\nHowTo100M offer broad coverage, they often include noise and\nirrelevant data. Future efforts should focus on curating high-quality, balanced datasets that prioritize diversity and accuracy\nwithout sacrificing scale. Semi-supervised and unsupervised\nlearning approaches could also mitigate the need for large\nannotated datasets.\niii. Addressing short-term bias: The dominance of short video\nclips in existing datasets limits models' ability to reason over\nextended sequences. Introducing datasets with long-term de-pendencies, such as episodic or procedural videos, would help\ntrain models to understand overarching narratives and transi-tions.\niv. Expanding dataset diversity: Current datasets often focus on\nnarrow domains, such as sports or cooking, which restricts\nmodel generalizability [156]. Diverse datasets encompassing\na wider range of cultural contexts, real-world scenarios, and\ntasks are essential to improve performance across applications.\nCollaborative initiatives between academic and industry stake-holders could accelerate the development of such datasets.\nv. Improving multimodal alignment: Misalignment between video\nframes and associated text or audio annotations introduces inconsistencies that can degrade learning quality. Future work\ncould explore more precise alignment methods [161, 162, 166,\n167], such as neural alignment models or reinforcement learn-ing frameworks, to ensure that temporal and semantic signals\nare accurately correlated during training.\nEnhancing temporal understanding. To improve temporal\nreasoning, joint training of encoders and LLMs is a promising di-rection. Models co-trained on datasets with temporal reasoning\ntasks can develop a deeper understanding of complex time-related"}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "This work critically examines the temporal reasoning capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in video processing, identifying sig-nificant limitations in both models and datasets. While LLMs paired\nwith pretrained visual encoders have achieved success in tasks such\nas action recognition, anomaly detection, and video summarization,\nthey fall short in understanding long-term temporal dependencies.\nThis stems from the encoders' focus on short-term patterns, frag-mented temporal cues, and challenges in aligning spatial, temporal,\nand semantic information. Additionally, existing datasets lack ex-plicit temporal annotations, often focus on short clips over long\nsequences, and struggle with diversity and multimodal alignment,\nfurther hindering progress.\nTo unlock the full potential of LLMs in video processing, fu-ture research must address these gaps. This includes designing\nintegrated frameworks to jointly train encoders and LLMs on tem-poral reasoning, enriching datasets with detailed annotations for\nlong-term dependencies, and creating innovative architectures that\nfuse spatiotemporal and semantic information.

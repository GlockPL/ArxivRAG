As the number of vehicles on the road continues to grow, the demand for robust vehicle detection systems capable of operating under varying conditions\u2014such as changes in weather, lighting, and vehicle types has become paramount. In traffic monitoring, vehicle detection enables the real-time analysis of traffic patterns, congestion management, and incident detection, contributing to more efficient urban mobility. Moreover, vehicle detection serves as the foundation for vehicle classification and tracking systems, which are essential for dynamic tolling, traffic law enforcement, and infrastructure planning [2].\n\nThe evolution of vehicle detection systems has been closely tied to advancements in deep learning, particularly in the field of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [3]. CNNs have played a pivotal role in object detection tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw image data [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Traditional vehicle detection approaches, such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)[9] and support vector machines (SVM)[10], lacked the flexibility and scalability needed for modern applications, especially when dealing with complex scenes and varying environmental conditions. Subsequent methods, like Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) [11], introduced improvements in detecting and describing features under varying scale and rotation conditions, although computational constraints limited real-time applicability for ITS. Despite these\nstrengths, traditional techniques often faced challenges in cluttered environments and occlusions [12]. The reliance on hand-crafted features made them less adaptive to the complex and dynamic scenes encountered in traffic settings. Thus, traditional methods were limited in their scalability and robustness, paving the way for machine learning approaches that leveraged data-driven learning for better generalization [13].\n\nAs machine learning began to influence vehicle detection, researchers turned to more adaptive approaches that could automatically learn object features from data. The introduction of deep learning marked a substantial shift, especially with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [14], which allowed for end-to-end learning and reduced reliance on manual feature selection. The shift towards deep learning-based models addressed these limitations, with CNN-based architectures becoming the de facto standard for object detection. Within the realm of CNN-based object detection, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) family of models has emerged as a groundbreaking solution, known for its real-time detection capabilities and high accuracy. The original YOLO model [15] approached object detection as a regression problem, enabling the simultaneous prediction of bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from image pixels. This one-stage detection framework offered a significant speed advantage over traditional two-stage detectors like Region-CNN (R-CNN) [16] and Faster R-CNN [17], which required multiple passes through the network to generate region proposals and refine detections.\n\nYOLO has undergone several iterations, each improving upon its predecessors. YOLOv1 introduced the concept of dividing an image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each cell [15, 18]. YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 refined the architecture by incorporating techniques like batch normalization, anchor boxes, and multi-scale detection, significantly enhancing accuracy for small and complex objects [19, 20]. YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 further optimized the network's backbone and head, integrating features like Cross-Stage Partial Networks (CSPNet) and Path Aggregation Networks (PANet) to improve feature extraction and fusion [21, 22]. More recent iterations, including YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, focused on improving inference speed and computational efficiency, making these models highly suitable for real-time applications [23, 24]. YOLOv8 introduced support for a broader range of tasks such as segmentation and tracking, and adopted anchor-free detection mechanisms, significantly improving its ability to generalize across diverse datasets [25].\n\nIn parallel, the development of other deep learning architectures, such as Vision Transformers (ViTs), has further expanded the horizon of object detection technologies [26]. ViTs have demonstrated superior performance in tasks requiring large-scale image recognition by leveraging self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies within images [27, 28]. Although ViTs excel in many areas, CNN-based models like YOLO continue to dominate real-time object detection due to their efficiency and adaptability in handling tasks with strict latency requirements, such as autonomous driving and traffic monitoring. Building on the strengths of previous YOLO models, YOLO11 represents the latest iteration in this evolutionary series [29]. It introduces novel architectural enhancements, including improved attention mechanisms, deeper feature extraction layers, and an anchor-free detection paradigm. These innovations are designed to address the challenges of detecting smaller, occluded, or rapidly moving vehicles while maintaining the model's real-time inference capability. YOLO11 is also optimized for hardware acceleration, making it more compatible with edge devices used in critical applications such as emotion detection [30] and intelligent transportation systems. The advancements in YOLO, particularly with the introduction of YOLO11, signify a step forward in the development of robust and scalable vehicle detection systems. By building on deep learning innovations, including CNNs and modern self-attention architectures like ViTs, YOLO11 aims to further bridge the gap between detection accuracy and computational efficiency in real-world applications.\n\nThis paper aims to evaluate the performance of YOLO11 in the context of vehicle detection, focusing on its ability to handle complex and real-time detection scenarios. By leveraging the advancements in deep learning and integrating architectural innovations, YOLO11 seeks to improve detection accuracy for a wide range of vehicle types, includ- ing smaller and partially occluded objects, while maintaining efficiency suitable for real-time applications such as autonomous driving and traffic management.\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of YOLO11, benchmarking its results against its predecessors, YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 [31]. Key metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP) are used to assess its strengths and limitations. Additionally, we examine YOLO11's real-world applicability in intelligent transportation systems by analyzing its speed and robustness under diverse conditions. Through this evaluation, the paper aims to highlight YOLO11's contributions to the field of vehicle detection and provide insights into its practical use for next-generation transportation systems."}, {"title": "2 Methodology", "content": "For the evaluation of YOLO11 in vehicle detection, we utilized the same dataset employed in our previous analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLOv10.

This strength is largely due to the addition of the Cross Stage Partial with Spatial Attention (C2PSA) block, which enhances the model's spatial attention capability, allowing it to focus effectively on specific regions of the image. This advancement reduces the likelihood of missing smaller or partially occluded vehicles, which is crucial in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring and autonomous driving.\n\nFurthermore, YOLO11 demonstrates balanced performance in terms of precision and recall, achieving consistently high scores across various vehicle types, particularly for commonly encountered objects like cars and buses. This balance\nsignifies that the model is not only adept at identifying true positives but also effective at minimizing false detections, which is essential for safety-critical applications. The higher mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved by YOLO11 at multiple Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds reinforces its robustness and accuracy under diverse conditions.\n\nIn addition to its accuracy, YOLO11's optimized architecture enables impressive real-time performance, reaching an inference speed of 290 frames per second (FPS). This combination of computational efficiency and high detection accuracy positions YOLO11 as a robust solution for applications that demand rapid response times, such as real-time surveillance and autonomous vehicle navigation.\n\nAnother key strength of YOLO11 is its robustness across different environmental conditions and object sizes. This adaptability is particularly beneficial in complex scenes with visual clutter or low-light conditions, suggesting that YOLO11 can be reliably deployed in a wide range of operational settings.\n\nHowever, despite these strengths, YOLO11 exhibits certain limitations. A primary weakness lies in its difficulty distinguishing between visually similar vehicle types, such as trucks and buses, especially when they are partially occluded or viewed from challenging angles. This misclassification is evident in the confusion matrix, where certain classes are frequently confused, indicating that additional refinement in feature extraction or contextual learning methods may be needed.\n\nYOLO11 also shows reduced performance on rare or underrepresented classes. While it performs exceptionally well on frequent vehicle types like cars and motorcycles, its recall for trucks, for example, is lower, highlighting a limitation in handling less common objects. This suggests that YOLO11's architecture might benefit from adjustments to improve detection for rare classes, which is crucial for comprehensive detection in diverse environments.\n\nAnother noted limitation is YOLO11's sensitivity to high confidence thresholds. The recall-confidence curve reveals that as the confidence threshold increases, recall drops significantly for certain classes, such as trucks and motorcycles, more sharply than for others, like cars. This indicates that, while YOLO11 achieves high precision, some objects may be missed at higher confidence thresholds, which could be a concern in applications prioritizing recall.\n\nFinally, although YOLO11 demonstrates robustness across various environmental conditions, it may still face challenges in scenarios drastically different from its training data. For instance, unique lighting conditions, extreme weather, or scenes with significant occlusion could impact performance. Incorporating techniques such as domain adaptation or transfer learning could help YOLO11 generalize better to unfamiliar environments, enhancing its adaptability.\n\nIn summary, YOLO11's strengths in detecting small and occluded vehicles, achieving high accuracy and speed, and demonstrating robustness across varied conditions make it a powerful model for real-time vehicle detection. However, addressing its limitations in distinguishing similar classes, handling rare objects, and adapting to highly variable conditions could further enhance its performance and reliability."}, {"title": "6.2 Real-World Implications", "content": "The capabilities of YOLO11 in vehicle detection have substantial potential applications across various real-world systems that require high accuracy, efficiency, and real-time object recognition.

Urban Surveillance and Security In urban surveillance applications, accurate detection of vehicle types can assist in crime prevention and law enforcement. YOLO11's high mean Average Precision (mAP) and real-time inference speed allow it to process live video feeds from surveillance cameras, enabling authorities to track vehicles of interest and respond quickly to incidents. Additionally, the model's robustness in varied lighting and weather conditions makes it suitable for outdoor surveillance, where environmental factors can impact visibility. Integrating YOLO11 into surveillance systems can enhance security by tracking stolen vehicles, monitoring traffic violations, and identifying suspicious behavior in real time.\n\n4.

This optimization is crucial for maintaining an optimal user experience and requires extensive data collection and analysis. One of the primary methods for gathering this data is through drive tests, where technical teams use specialized equipment to collect signal information across various regions. However, drive tests are both costly and time-consuming, and they face challenges such as traffic conditions, environmental factors, and limited access to certain areas. These constraints make it difficult to replicate drive tests under similar conditions. In this study, we propose a method that enables operators to predict received signal strength at specific locations using data from other drive test points. By reducing the need for widespread drive tests, this approach allows operators to save time and resources while still obtaining the necessary data to optimize their networks and mitigate the challenges associated with traditional drive tests.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Mobile network operators are constantly working to assess and enhance the performance of their networks. Network optimization involves fine-tuning various parameters to ensure better coverage, increased capacity, and an improved overall user experience. Without continuous optimization, networks can suffer from congestion, weak signal quality, and limited data speeds, all of which negatively impact the user's Quality of Experience (QoE).\nFrom here on, we will refer to network users as User Equipment (UE). It is evident that measuring the status of UEs plays a crucial role in the network optimization process. In a mobile network, multiple parameters, such as signal strength and quality, known in 4G networks as Reference Signal Recieved Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Recieved Quality (RSRQ), can be measured [1]. The challenge, however, lies in the fact that many of these parameters cannot easily be accessed by the operator from the network core or Radio Access Network (RAN) side. Therefore, it becomes clear that a practical solution is to measure these parameters from the perspective of the end-user, or UE.\nUE-side data is particularly important as it provides a real-time view of the network's performance from the user's perspective. This data helps identify coverage gaps, detect areas with weak signal quality, and understand user behavior patterns. With this information, operators can make informed decisions about adjusting network configurations, deploying additional infrastructure, or implementing new technologies to enhance network performance. Without accurate user data, optimization efforts would rely solely on theoretical models and assumptions, which may not accurately reflect the real user experience."}, {"title": "1.1 Motivation", "content": "Mobile network operators use several methods to measure important network parameters, with drive test and minimal drive test being two of the most widely used. Drive test, in simple terms, involves sending teams into the field to gather and analyze network data like signal strength, call quality, and other key metrics. However, even the smallest change in the network setup requires another round of testing, which can be both time-consuming and expensive. To tackle these issues, minimal drive test was introduced. This method uses data sent by UEs, such as in Measurement Reports, to the network, helping to cut down on the need for large-scale field tests. Still, this approach has its own set of challenges, like the fact that it only works when the device is connected and doesn't capture all the needed parameters. Operators must carefully manage these complexities, balancing cost considerations with network optimization and user satisfaction. In short, drive test and minimal drive test are both essential for maintaining high-quality mobile services.\nDrive test also faces some real-world challenges. It's costly, requires special equipment, and involves a large team. Plus, there are many areas where conducting a drive test is just not practical. Narrow streets, parks, courtyards, and similar spots are hard to reach or unsuitable for repeated tests. These limitations motivated us to explore how we can predict network performance data in places where running a drive test isn?t feasible. By predicting data, we mean finding ways to estimate network performance in areas where physically testing isn't possible."}, {"title": "1.2 Contribution", "content": "As shown in Figure 1, this paper focuses on drive test in mobile networks. Among the various challenges in this field, our focus is on predicting network performance in areas where data collection is difficult. The aim is to address data gaps in these regions, ensuring they benefit from enhanced network optimization. By predicting data for these locations, we aim to broaden the scope of network optimization and provide a more comprehensive and accurate picture of network performance in all environments. The main innovations presented in this paper are:\n\u2713 A new approach to estimate path loss parameters for predicting the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) in 4G networks, using an optimization-based method with only the location information of the cells.\n\u2713 A novel technique to estimate the standard deviation of noise caused by shadowing in the channel without needing cell location data.\n\u2714 An assessment of our proposed methods using real-world data collected from the Mobile Communication Company of Iran?s network, enabled by a locally developed Android tool called Venus [2]."}, {"title": "1.3 Paper Structure", "content": "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In \u00a72, we review the previous work in this field. \u00a73 outlines the system model and assumptions, followed by a detailed explanation of our proposed method. \u00a74 presents an evaluation of the proposed method using real-world data.

As shown in Figure 1, network optimization can be achieved through the collection of field data via drive test or through network-side data collection using minimal drive test. When it comes to optimizing drive tests, there are three main approaches: route optimization, network optimization based on data, and data prediction.\nThe concept of minimal drive test was developed as an alternative to traditional drive test. It leverages data collected by network users during their everyday usage, significantly reducing the need for physical drive tests. By gathering extensive data directly from users, this approach allows for effective network optimization. Studies such as [3, 4] have explored the use of minimal drive testing to improve network performance and optimize network parameters.\nIn the realm of drive test optimization, route optimization is a method used before conducting the drive tests. This technique focuses on selecting optimal routes that provide the most valuable data with minimal cost and time. Research papers like [5, 6] offer solutions to the challenges of route planning and optimization.\nOn the other hand, data-based network optimization involves using data collected from drive tests to improve network configurations. In this approach, once the drive test is completed, the collected data is analyzed, and necessary adjustments are made to enhance network performance. Studies such as [7, 8] demonstrate how these changes can lead to improved network service quality.\nThe primary focus of our research is on data prediction, an approach aimed at estimating network parameters in areas where drive tests have not been conducted. By leveraging existing drive test data, this method predicts parameters such as RSRP and RSRQ, enabling operators to optimize networks without the need for drive tests in every area. Numerous studies have been conducted in this domain, and we will review some of the most significant ones.\nOne notable study in this field is presented in [9], which uses drive test data from six base transceiver stations to improve path loss prediction in 4G networks using machine learning. This study illustrates that, unlike traditional models that are rigid and inflexible, machine learning models, such as Radial Basis Functions (RBFs), offer better accuracy and adaptability, overcoming the limitations of existing models.\nIn the field of path loss prediction, newer methods have emerged that go beyond the traditional machine learning approaches. [10] focus on using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict path loss for base stations in rural environments. Their findings suggest that a relatively simple ANN model, when trained with drive test data, can"}, {"title": "3 Proposed Approach", "content": "We begin by outlining the system model and the assumptions that underpin our approach. Following this, we provide a detailed explanation of the proposed method for predicting drive test data."}, {"title": "3.1 System Model and Assumptions", "content": "We assume that a drive test has been conducted, but certain locations, due to various constraints or intentionally, have not been covered. The goal of this study is to estimate the network parameters for these uncovered locations, an area referred to as data prediction.\nData prediction can generally be divided into two main categories:\n\u2022 Static Prediction: In this approach, it is assumed that the drive test has been completed, and the aim is to estimate the uncovered locations using various methods.\n\u2022 Dynamic Prediction: This approach involves actively participating in the drive test process in real-time, where the model is continuously updated with new data as it becomes available.\nTo better understand the modeling process and the implementation of the proposed method, the following assumptions have been made:\n1. The network under study is assumed to be a 4G network. This assumption allows for a focused analysis of the specific challenges and needs of this generation of networks. However, the proposed methods can easily be extended to other network generations.\n2. The focus is on the RSRP parameter. RSRP is a critical indicator of signal quality and plays a key role in evaluating and improving the performance of mobile networks.\n3. It is assumed that the locations and configurations of all base stations in the network are known. This information is essential for creating an accurate and effective model since the base station locations directly impact RSRP prediction results.\n4. The drive test is conducted using a mobile device moving at a speed of less than 40 km/h.\n5. The ellipsoidal coordinate system is used as the reference coordinate system."}, {"title": "3.2 Proposed Methodology", "content": ""}, {"title": "3.2.1 Points Selection", "content": "The first step in the proposed approach is to select suitable points for predicting RSRP values. This process is crucial because the data from these points form the foundation for subsequent calculations and predictions.\nFigure 2 illustrates an example of a drive test. The points shown in gray represent locations where RSRP was not measured, while the colored points indicate locations where RSRP was measured.\nSuppose we want to estimate the RSRP value at a point with coordinates $p_t = (x_t, y_t)$. To do this, we draw a circle with radius $R$ around this point. All points within this circle, for which RSRP information is available, are considered in the channel modeling and estimation process. These points inside the circle are denoted by $\\Phi$ and are defined as follows:\n$\\Phi = \\{p_i | d_{it} < R, \\text{Has RSRP measurement}\\},$ (1)\nHere, $d_{it}$ represents the distance between $p_t$ and $p_i$. The radius $R$ of the circle plays a crucial role in prediction accuracy. Increasing the radius allows more points to be included in the calculations, thereby providing the model with more data. However, if the radius is too large, it could reduce prediction accuracy due to the inclusion of points with different environmental and cellular conditions. Conversely, reducing the radius might limit"}, {"title": "3.2.2 Cells Identification and Points Grouping", "content": "Within the set $\\Phi$, several points have associated RSRP values. These points might be connected to one or more serving cells. The first step here is to identify the serving cells present within this area and then group the points based on the cell to which they are connected.\nConsider a point $p_i \\in \\Phi$ that lies within a circle of radius $R$ with a specific RSRP value. Let $C_j$ denote the identifier of the serving cell at that point. We can then divide the points in $\\Phi$ into different groups according to their serving cells. Thus, $\\Phi_k$ is a subset of $\\Phi$ ($\\Phi_k \\subseteq \\Phi$) where all points are connected to a specific cell:\n$\\Phi_k = \\{p_i \\in \\Phi | p_i \\text{ is connected to } C_j\\}$ (2)\nFigure 3 illustrates these concepts. Each color represents a user connected to a different cell. As you can see, in the hypothetical circle centered at point $p_t$, the drive test points are connected to four different cells. Consequently, we have four subsets: $\\Phi_1$, $\\Phi_2$, $\\Phi_3$ and $\\Phi_4$."}, {"title": "3.2.3 Path Loss Modeling", "content": "For modeling path loss, we employ the simple yet effective Friis model, widely used in telecommunications due to its minimal parameter requirements and reasonable accuracy. The model is defined as follows:\n$P_r = P_o - 10\\beta \\log_{10} (\\frac{d}{d_o}) [dB],$ (3)\nHere, $P_r$ represents the received power at a distance $d$. The parameter $P_o$ denotes the received power at a reference distance $d_o$. The two key parameters in this model that need estimation are $P_o$ and $\\beta$ (the path loss exponent).\nFirst, we identify the points connected to each cell within the area of interest and calculate the distance of these points from their respective transmitters. Various methods for calculating distances in the ellipsoidal coordinate system are discussed in [14]; we use the following relation in our study:\n$d_{ij} = R_e \\cdot \\arccos(\\sin(\\xi_i) \\sin(\\xi_j) + \\cos(\\xi_i) \\cos(\\xi_j) \\cos(\\xi(Y_i - Y_j))),$ (4)\nwhere $R_e$ represents the radius of the Earth, which, we consider to be 6371000 meters. Next, using the available data, we aim to estimate the Friis model parameters $P_o$ and $\\beta$ by solving an optimization problem. Initially, the measured received power data, along with the locations where the measurements were taken, are organized into a data matrix for each $\\Phi_k$, or more precisely, for each individual cell.\nData = $\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & P_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & P_2 \\ & & \\ x_{N_k} & y_{N_k} & P_{N_k} \\ \\end{bmatrix}$ (5)\nwhere $N_k$ represents the number of measurements for each $\\Phi_k$. The parameters $x_i$ and $y_i$ correspond to the latitude and longitude, respectively, and $P_i$ indicates the received power at the i-th measurement in dBm units.\nOur objective is to find the best estimates for the two unknown parameters as described in (3). If the received power strictly followed the model in (3), we could estimate the parameters using only two measurements. However, measurements are often not precise and are subject to various sources of error. To model this uncertainty, let's assume that the measurements $P_i$ taken by the user are corrupted by Gaussian noise. This gives us:\n$P_i = P_o - \\beta \\log_{10} \\frac{d_i}{d_o} + N(0, \\sigma_i), i \\in [1, N_k]$ (6)\nHere, the noise is assumed to be Gaussian with a mean of zero and standard deviation $\\sigma_i$. In other words, we consider only the impact of shadowing noise due to large obstacles obstructing the signal path, ignoring other errors such as user location inaccuracies and thermal noise. Without loss of generality, we also assume that $d_o = 1$.\nNext, we aim to use the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to derive an appropriate estimate for the unknown parameters of the problem. It can be shown that in certain cases, MLE provides an optimal solution.\nLemma 1. If the noise in equation (6) follows a Gaussian distribution, then MLE is optimal from the perspective of the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), which represents the minimum variance for the parameter we want to estimate.\nProof. Please see [15, \u00a7\u00a711.5.1].\nIt is important to note that this rule holds only when the noise in (6) is Gaussian. In other cases, MLE may not necessarily yield the optimal solution. To estimate the unknown parameters using MLE, we need to construct the likelihood function. If we assume that the measurements are independent of each other, the likelihood function becomes (9), where the parameters in this relation are defined as follows:\n\u2022 $C_P$: The covariance matrix of the measurements. It is given by:\n|$C_P$| = $\\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_1^2 & 0 & 0 & ... & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_2^2 & 0 & ... & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & ... & \\sigma_{N_k}^2 \\end{bmatrix} = diag(\\sigma_1^2, \\sigma_2^2, ..., \\sigma_{N_k}^2)$ (7)\nwhere $\\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of the noise for the i-th measurement."}, {"title": "3.2.4 Shadowing Noise Estimation", "content": "Figure 4 illustrates how the points recorded in a drive test are connected to their corresponding cell. According to (6), the received power is influenced by both path loss and shadowing noise. As discussed earlier, we assume the shadowing effect follows a Gaussian noise model with zero mean and a standard deviation of $\\sigma$. In practice, this means that during a drive test, all measurements associated with a particular cell assume that the value of $\\sigma$ remains constant across these measurements.\nOur first step is to estimate the standard deviation of the shadowing noise, as this parameter plays a critical role in determining the accuracy"}, {"title": "4 Evaluation", "content": "In this section, we evaluate the proposed approach using real-world data collected from various drive tests. The experimental setup, data collection process, and the resulting outcomes are analyzed and discussed in detail."}, {"title": "4.1 Data Collection", "content": "To gather the necessary data, a series of drive tests were conducted across Districts 2 and 4 of Tehran. These tests were carried out using an Android-based application developed by Parto Ertebat Saba, a knowledge-based company [2], with direct involvement from the authors of this paper. The collected data includes signal measurements such as RSRP and RSRQ. In addition to these signal measurements, we also have access to precise location information and identifiers of the serving cells, obtained from available databases. This supplementary information has helped us in grouping the data points and refining the analysis.\nThe total distance covered during these drive tests exceeded 600 kilometers, with more than 20,000 measurement points accurately recorded."}, {"title": "4.2 Experimental Setup", "content": "As shown in Figure 6, some points in the collected dataset lack measurements. These points, for which no signal data was recorded, have been excluded from further analysis. The absence of measurements in these areas is due to the fact that the sampling rate was lower than the speed of the moving vehicle. Our main focus is on the points where valid measurements are available to ensure a reliable assessment of the proposed method.\nAfter filtering out the points without measurements, the next step is to estimate the received power at each of the remaining points. Following the proposed method, surrounding points are selected and grouped to be used as inputs for the optimization model, allowing us to accurately estimate the received power.\nAt this stage, we use the optimization problem described earlier to model the environment?s channel, taking into account shadowing noise. Finally, we estimate the RSRP at each point. This estimation, calculated using the channel model and noise data, determines the received power at each point. To evaluate the proposed method, the estimation error is computed as the difference between the actual RSRP values obtained from the drive test and the estimated values. This"}, {"title": "4.3 Impact of Parameters on Model Performance", "content": "Several key parameters play a crucial role in modeling the channel and estimating received power. These parameters include:\n\u2022 Radius of the Hypothetical Circle (R): This determines which surrounding points are used for estimating the received power at a target location.\n\u2022 Minimum Number of Points Connected to a Cell: This specifies the minimum number of valid measurement points required for a cell to be included in the calculations. If a cell has fewer points, it is excluded from the analysis.\n\u2022 Minimum Distance of Measurement Points from the Serving Cell: This defines the minimum distance a measurement point must be from the antenna to be considered valid for modeling and estimation.\nThese parameters significantly impact the final results, and their effects are analyzed and evaluated in the following sections. We conducted several experiments using the drive test data to assess the influence of these three critical parameters on the performance of our proposed model. For this purpose, we designed two sets of experiments. In the first experiment, we kept the minimum distance of points from the antenna fixed while varying the radius and the minimum number of points connected to a cell. In the second experiment, we fixed the minimum number of points connected to a cell and varied the radius and the minimum distance from the antenna.\nTo evaluate and compare the model's performance with different parameter settings, we used box plots. These plots allow us to better understand the spread and trends of the measurement errors. Unlike metrics such as the mean, which provide only a general overview of errors, box plots offer a more detailed examination of error distribution and outliers."}, {"title": "4.3.1 Impact of Number of Points and Circle Radius", "content": "In Figure 7, each box plot represents a different minimum number of points connected to a cell. Within each plot, separate boxes for various radii display the measured errors. This representation allows us to examine how each model parameter influences the measurement errors and analyze the results.\nBased on the experimental results, it is evident that the minimum number of points connected to a cell does not significantly affect the outcomes, as the results remain fairly consistent. Similarly, varying the radius parameter does not result in major differences in the outcomes. However, a radius of 50 meters shows less variation in the RSRP estimation error. This suggests that smaller radii lead to more accurate predictions, likely because points with similar environmental and channel conditions are grouped together. In contrast, as the radius increases, the shadowing noise varies more between measurements, moving the results further from the optimal case."}, {"title": "4.3.2 Impact of Minimum Distance Parameter", "content": "As seen in Figure 8, changing the minimum distance of points from the antenna has a similar lack of impact on model performance as the minimum number of connected points. This is because, when measurement points are located beyond the Fraunhofer distance, (3) remains valid."}, {"title": "4.3.3 summary", "content": "Figure 9 provides a comprehensive overview of how the discussed parameters influence the average error. By analyzing this figure, which illustrates the effects of the radius and minimum number of connected points, we can draw important conclusions regarding the accuracy of the model in predicting RSRP. As shown in the graph, under certain model configurations, the average error is reduced to highly desirable levels. Specifically, with smaller radii and fewer connected points, the model performs better, minimizing prediction error. These results demonstrate the robustness of our model in accurately predicting RSRP. The significant reduction in error highlights the model's effectiveness under optimal conditions."}, {"title": "4.3.4 Impact of Shadowing Noise on Prediction Error", "content": "In the scatter plots presented in Figure 10, the relationship between prediction error and shadowing noise across different radii is illustrated. A clear pattern emerges from these graphs, indicating that as shadowing noise increases, the prediction error also rises. This trend highlights that shadowing noise plays a crucial role in diminishing the accuracy of the prediction model.\nAcross all the presented plots, we observe that in regions where the error is low, the shadowing noise is also minimal. In such cases, the model provides highly accurate predictions of the received signal strength, leading to minimal estimation error. However, as the level of shadowing noise increases, the likelihood of larger prediction errors also grows. This direct correlation underscores the significant impact of shadowing noise on the model?s accuracy."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "To optimize their networks, operators rely on accurate data to evaluate various network parameters. One of the primary methods for gathering this data is through drive tests, which collect field data about network performance in different areas.

This research aimed to address these challenges by proposing an efficient method for predicting RSRP in areas where drive test data is unavailable."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "The comprehensive deployment of 5G has driven exploration into 6G, propelling wireless communication technology from \"Ubiquitous Connectivity\u201d towards \u201cIntelligent Connectivity\u201d. This transformation has given rise to numerous emerging applications and services such as holographic communication, multidimensional sensing, and ubiquitous intelligence. To meet the demands of these new applications and services, 6G faces tremendous challenges, including ultra-dense network deployment, massive ultra-reliable and low latency communications, and self-sustaining system [1], [2]. In light of these challenges, digital twin (DT) is being considered as a powerful candidate for driving the design, analysis, and operation of 6G, thanks to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and semiconductor fabrication technology. By leveraging real-time monitoring and interaction with the physical world, DT enables the creation of highly accurate digital replicas of the physical space. Furthermore, the integration of AI empowers DT to enhance decision-making processes within the physical networks [3], [4].\nWireless digital twin networks (WDTNs) play an essential role as high-fidelity digital replicas of the entire lifecycle of the 6G physical network. The proposed architecture integrates seamlessly with ongoing efforts on standardized network architectures. WDTNs enhance the 6G ecosystem by continuously evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of quality of service (QoS) strategies via real-time monitoring, simulation, and analysis of the physical network. DT-driven approach not only optimizes and predicts the behavior of the physical system to ensure optimal performance, but also supports proactive decision-making. Furthermore, the architecture is designed to facilitate cooperation and coexistence with standardized network frameworks, ensuring it complement and extend existing and emerging standards. Moreover, WTDNs integrate multi-access edge computing (MEC) for the deployment of DTs, utilizing communication and computational collaboration with multiple edge servers and end devices to effectively reduce communication latency. Meanwhile, DT supported by AI facilitates the decision-making process through real-time interaction between the digital and physical realms [5].\nSeveral notable research work have explored the role of DTs in optimizing different aspects of WDTNs. For example, the work [6] applied AI techniques into DT to enhance the design of edge computing networks. By mirroring the dynamic network in DT, AI is applied to implement real-time resource allocation, which effectively improves energy efficiency and data processing efficiency. In [7], an adaptive aerial edge computing network was proposed. The network utilized DT to achieve real-time environmental predictions, guiding intelligent offloading strategies and resource allocation. As a result, the network's energy consumption was significantly reduced. In [8], the authors integrated DT with blockchain to improve network security, in which an intelligent task offloading algorithm was developed to reduce delay and energy consumption while ensuring data security. Another hot research issue is to ensure the provision of reliable and accurate WDTNs. This requires careful consideration of real-time synchronization between the physical devices and their corresponding DTs. In [9], the authors developed a model for DT synchronization, aiming to minimize the age of information associated with DT data. The authors in [10] investigated DT synchronization problem in vehicular networks and analyzed the association between DT and wireless access points. The objective was to achieve low-latency synchronization between DTs and access points. Furthermore, in [11], the authors considered social characteristics, computation resources, and user mobility in their analysis of DT deployment. They proposed an approximation algorithm to minimize the synchronization delay. Last but not least, the mobility of mobile users (MUs) may lead to scenarios where direct synchronization between physical users and their DTs is not feasible. In such cases, DT migration"}, {"title": "II. WIRELESS DIGITAL TWIN NETWORKS", "content": "In this section, we start by introducing a three-tier network architecture for WDTNs that incorporates various advanced techniques. We then proceed to identify key issues that currently exist within WDTNs."}, {"title": "A. The Architecture of WDTNs", "content": "The WDTNs framework is designed as a three-tier architecture, as depicted in Fig. 1. This architecture consists of the physical layer, digital twin layer, and application layer. The physical layer provides data for the development of the digital twin layer. With the aid of 6G network, the digital twin layer is responsible for model construction, item mapping, and policy optimization. The application layer is a platform designed to deliver comprehensive services and applications. The detailed components of the three-tier network are sorted out as follows:\nPhysical layer: The physical layer primarily comprises various devices, base stations (BSs), and other entities that form the communication system. In the context of 6G, advanced supplements such as THz communication and RIS play a significant role in enhancing the capabilities of these entities. These devices utilize the THz frequency range for high-speed data transmission to gather raw data. By leveraging the beamforming and reflection properties of RIS, these data are efficiently transmitted to the BS and further uploaded to the digital twin layer. The digital twin layer extensively processes the received raw data to create information that accurately maps the state of the environment, facilitating real-time interaction and control with the physical layer. It is noteworthy that BSs are strategically positioned in close proximity to the devices in order to provide wireless interfaces, ensuring seamless and instant communication within the network. These BSs also incorporate edge servers, which greatly enhance the computational and data processing capabilities of the devices. In addition, SC is used to optimize the collected data, ensuring that only information relevant to specific task objectives is conveyed. This optimization of data transmission reduces communication overhead and enhances the overall operational efficiency of the system.\nDigital twin layer: The digital twin layer is the core of the WDTNs architecture, serving as a bridge between the physical and the application layers. It ensures the efficient operation of the network by comprising three key elements: data storage, virtual model mapping, and twin management. Firstly, data storage collects key data, including real-time environmental inputs, experiential insights, and historical records, providing the foundation for model creation and refinement. Secondly, virtual model mapping precisely replicates the physical network using the filtered data, ensuring that the digital twin reflects its state in real-time and predicts future performance. In this process, LLMs utilize their capabilities to transform complex data into more easily understandable information, helping managers make faster and wiser decisions. Lastly, twin management is responsible for supervising the real-time synchronization between the digital twin and its physical counterpart. DRL technology plays a crucial role, achieving automated optimization and maintenance of the network through continuous learning and strategy adjustments. The combination of these elements not only makes the digital twin layer become the neural center for managing WDTNs but also endows wireless networks with unprecedented adaptive capabilities and intelligent decision-making. As a result, the network becomes more stable, responsive, and capable of flexibly addressing"}, {"title": "B. Key Issues and Potential Enablers", "content": "In the considered WDTNs paradigm, achieving real-time model synchronization and intelligent mirroring of physical entities is of paramount importance. This requires the digital twin layer to possess self-optimization, self-configuration, and self-healing capabilities to accurately map physical entities to virtual twins. Specifically, to achieve the precise mapping of physical entities to virtual twins in WDTNs, we address the following key issues to enhance their adaptability.\nSC in WDTNS: SC meticulously filters the content of data transmission, ensuring that only information substantially contributing to the objectives of a task is conveyed. This strategy significantly alleviates communication load, thereby enhancing the system's overall efficiency. However, a challenge encountered in this process is that the core of the WDTNs is to construct digital replicas of physical entities in the virtual space. Introducing SC into this requires considering how to map the semantic information of the physical world to the virtual world, and how to feed back the semantic information of the virtual world to the physical world. This necessitates the development of new semantic mapping models and mechanisms to achieve seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds. Moreover, physical entities and DTs need to be synchronized in real time. SC optimizes state synchronization by filtering and transmitting relevant data and its semantics, reducing transmission load. By employing SC for state synchronization, the transmitted data becomes more meaningful, ensuring improved system efficiency. However, this requires the synchronization mechanism to ensure real-time performance, consistency, and integrity of all synchronized information, including semantic data.\nLLMs in WDTNs: LLMs enhance intelligent interaction in the digital twin layer by understanding and generating text, improving user experience and facilitating seamless human-machine interaction. Furthermore, they aid in data analysis and decision-making by extracting insights from extensive textual data. However, LLMs require tremendous computational power, including high-performance processors and large memory capacities. To address these challenges, techniques such as model compression, model splitting, edge-cloud collaboration and adaptive inference can be employed to enable the deployment of LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices. Another crucial issue is the handling of sensitive information and personal data when LLMs process and generate text. To mitigate privacy concerns, techniques such as differential privacy, federated learning, and secure multi-party computation can be applied to ensure that sensitive information is protected during the training and inference of LLMs.\nTHz and RIS in WDTNS: THz and RIS are introduced as key enabling technologies in the physical layer. THz offer abundant spectrum resources, enabling wireless transmission at unprecedented speeds. However, they face challenges such as high directionality, propagation losses, and blockages, which may lead to signal degradation and service interruptions. To address these issues, high-gain directional antennas, advanced beam tracking and"}, {"title": "III. A CASE STUDY", "content": "The previous discussions have demonstrated the importance of employing machine learning solutions to address the key issues in WDTNs. In this section, we present a case study of 6G that specifically focuses on DT synchronization within WDTNs, considering the challenges posed by the highly dynamic nature and stringent reliability requirements in 6G networks. This case study highlights how machine learning-driven solvers can effectively tackle the synchronization problem, providing a practical solution for achieving efficient DT synchronization in WDTNs."}, {"title": "A. System Model", "content": "We consider a WDTN consisting of a control center, multiple BSs, and MUs. The control center is used to maintain the model training and the deployment decision of DTs. The movement of MUs follows a Gauss-Markov process, while the DT synchronization requests of MUs follow a Bernoulli distribution. Moreover, the wireless channels between MUs and BSs are modeled as Rician fading channels. Each BS is equipped with a server to assist MUs in constructing and synchronizing their DTs. To ensure the fidelity of WDTNs, the servers in BSs require synchronization of information from the MUs. Furthermore, the MUs may switch their BS associations after moving for a period of time which makes DT migration become imperative. However, the occurrence of synchronization failure cannot be completely avoided. Specifically, when a MU initiates a synchronization request, it may encounter failure under two conditions. Firstly, if the MU's DT is undergoing migration, it may be unable to establish synchronization successfully. Secondly, if the required synchronization time exceeds the latency requirement, the synchronization request is aborted. In this study, our objective is to minimize the long-term average energy consumption of the MUs taking into account the following three aspects: 1) Ensuring the reliability of DT synchronization. 2) Optimizing the deployment of DT, and 3) Efficiently allocating computational and communication resources. Considering the inherent structural properties of the optimization problem, we propose a learning-based solution."}, {"title": "B. Numerical Results", "content": "We evaluate the performance of our proposed Beta-HAPPO scheme by numerical simulations. The parameter settings are presented as follows. We consider a 1000 m \u00d7 1000 m square area, where the MUs are uniformly distributed. We set the number of MUs as 30 and the number of BSs as 5. Other default settings for environment and algorithm are typically based on the parameters in [14], [15]. For performance comparison, we focus on DRL approaches, as they provide a robust framework for dynamically adapting to complex network environments. The following benchmark schemes are used:\nGaussian-HAPPO: HAPPO adopts Gaussian distribution in actor networks.\nBeta-MAPPO: Multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) adopts Beta distribution in actor networks. Be noted that unlike HAPPO, agents need to share parameters among themselves.\nMADDPG: Multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) employs a deterministic policy with exploration noise and does not utilize distribution as the actor's output.\nFig. 3(a) shows the average energy consumption versus time steps. It can be observed from Fig. 3(a) that the average energy consumption steadily decreases as the time steps increase, indicating the effectiveness of DRL schemes. Moreover, Beta-HAPPO is better than Beta-MAPPO because HAPPO does not employ a parameter sharing strategy. Furthermore, HAPPO-based schemes exhibit significantly faster convergence speed compared to the MADDPG scheme. This is because the deterministic policy of MADDPG has insufficient exploration, resulting in insufficient quality and limited diversity of samples in the replay buffer, which hinders the learning progress and slows down the convergence speed. Moreover, Gaussian-HAPPO requires a higher energy consumption compared to Beta-HAPPO, validating that the Beta distribution is better than Gaussian distribution in the scenarios with bounded actions. In Fig. 3(b), we evaluate the impact of control factor \u03b7 on the energy consumption and synchronization failure ratio of MUs. As \u03b7 increases from 0.7 to 1.3, we observe that the energy consumption of MUs increases while the synchronization failure ratio decreases. This demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating the control factor to balance the trade-off between energy consumption and synchronization failure of MUs. Fig. 3(c) shows the average energy consumption versus the number of MUs. It can be observed that the average energy consumption of MUs gradually increases as the number of MUs increases. As the number of MUs increases, signal interference among them rises, consequently requiring higher transmission power and resulting in increased average energy consumption. Fig. 3(d) shows the synchronization failure ratio versus number of MUs. It can be observed that when the number of MUs is within 25, the synchronization failure ratio is 0; when the number of MUs exceeds 30, the synchronization failure ratio increases as the number of MUs increases. When the number of MUs is small, the network resources are sufficient to meet their DT synchronization needs. However, as the number of MUs increases without a corresponding increase in network resources, resources become exhausted, leading to insufficient allocation for DT synchronization and a rise in the failure ratio."}, {"title": "IV. CONCLUSION AND RESEARCH PROSPECTS", "content": "In this article, we conducted a comprehensive review for the architecture of WDTNs, exploring the integration of DT technology with future generation communication systems. We explicitly identified and discussed the intrinsic key issues associated with WDTNs, along with promising solutions. While the construction of WDTNs facilitates the development of data-driven and self-learning networks, leading to increased intelligence and automation, several challenges hinder their real implementations in practice. The complexity of network environments, uncertainty of data, and resource limitations in 6G wireless networks pose significant obstacles. Addressing these challenges is essential for the successful implementation of WDTNs. Here are some key challenges that require future attention in terms of efficiency, reliability, and real-world application. The efficiency aspect encompasses considerations related to data processing, resource utilization, and energy efficiency:\nData preprocessing: Data preprocessing is a critical step in constructing DTs models, providing a foundation of data for accurate DT synchronization. However, raw data often contains corrupted, improperly formatted, duplicated, or missing information. Consequently, thorough preprocessing and cleansing of the data are necessary to ensure data cleanliness and availability, thereby facilitating the precise construction and synchronization of DTs.\nResource management: Resource management in WDTNs is complex and challenging. This is due to the intricacy and dynamism of the radio environments in 6G communication networks. Moreover, the access of a large number of users further increases the burden on network resources. This necessitates the effective integration of machine learning algorithms into resource management to achieve adaptive and efficient network operations.\nEnergy consumption: The energy consumption issue in WDTNs is an urgent problem that needs to be resolved. This is due to the high computational demands of AI technologies. Moreover, the energy-intensive nature of dense network significantly exaggerates this challenge. To address this, measures such as implementing novel energy management and scheduling schemes, adopting green energy sources, applying power consumption optimization techniques, and hardware designs can be considered.\nFault-tolerant system: A fault-tolerant system is important for WDTNs. Due to the transmission of erroneous data between DT entities, the integrity of the entire digital twin layer could be compromised, thereby reducing the performance of the network. Therefore, effective fault tolerance mechanisms must be designed to mitigate the impact of faults and shorten the recovery times.\nPilot studies or real-world trials: Conducting pilot trials and real-world experiments is crucial. Deploying the algorithm in real WDTNs will provide valuable insights into its performance under practical constraints and dynamic conditions. These trials will identify potential challenges and limitations that may not be apparent in simulations, such as hardware imperfections, communication delays, and scalability issues. Real-world validation will enable fine-tuning of the algorithms and adaptation to specific application scenarios. In order to bridge the gap between simulation and reality, pilot trials will pave the way for successful implementation of the proposed approach in practical WDTNs."}]}

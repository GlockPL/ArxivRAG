The consequences of this accelerated immersion is a wide variety of organizational structures supporting various forms of Data Science initiatives. This includes everything from single departments inside pre-existing colleges/schools to stand-alone schools with dedicated Deans and tenurable faculty. These varying approaches have produced significantly different academic programs and curriculum, with seemingly no two schools supporting identical coursework. This is nowhere more evident than with a simple review of introductory data science courses from across the US higher education landscape. The results of which show a variety of topics and requirements that seem to be able to span several disciplines including Statistics and Computer Science. It is a result of this wide spectrum that the School of Data Science at the University of Virginia worked to establish a unifying vision of what a Data Science curriculum should encompass, free of prior influence. Rafael Alvardo outlines this perspective in his essay \u201cThe 4+1 Model of Data Science", "Two Cultures": 3, "entitled": "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century."}, {"title": "University of Virginia Model of Data Science", "content": "UVA's areas of Data Science model (4+1) was generated by Rafael Alvarado in collaboration with Data Science faculty in 2019 leading up to the official beginning of the School of Data Science in the fall of 2019. The framework is designed to represent areas of focus or areas that should be foundation to all data science curriculum. These include Value, Design, Systems, and Analytics. These areas are umbrella concepts that could and should encompass a variety of more specific learning outcomes dependent on context. However, implicit in the structure is that an effort to balance the curricular content across the four areas is critical, as each contains necessary aspects for becoming a successful data scientist. We see the movement toward this structure as a natural evolution of the field away from being viewed as subsets of Computer Science and Statistics/Mathematics (Figure 3 - left) to a new independent field with both cultural and intellectual uniqueness. Figure 3 (right) represents the four areas with practice being the use of these skills inside a specific area of expertise or project [1].\nValue represents the human aspects of Data Science and inherits methods and practices from the field of ethics, but considers data oriented business practices. Cultural movements that fall into this area are widely supported across the Data Science ecosystem such as \u201cData for Good\" or \u201cData and Society\u201d. Initiatives focus on \u201cOpen Data\u201d and transparency are additional examples that would align with the overarching concept of ethical data use..\""}, {"title": "THE BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE CURRICULUM AT UVA (BSDS)", "content": "Overview\nOn September 19th 2023 the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia (SCHEV) approved a bachelor's degree in Data Science at the University of Virginia (BSDS) [7]. The cornerstone of this degree is a novel curriculum based on the model of Data Science developed by Professor Rafael Alvarado which was outlined in the previous section. In this section we will describe the key features of this curriculum and how it brings the model of Data Science to life at the Undergraduate level.\nAt the University of Virginia the BSDS program resides within the School of Data Science (UVADS). During their first year the students take the two prerequisite courses for admission to the major program and apply over the summer. Those courses include DS 1001, which focuses on Foundational concepts and is unique among colleges globally, and DS 1002, which focuses on the use of computers in data science \u2013 specifically programming. The DS 1001 course is the subject of extended discussion further on in this paper.\nOnce admitted into the major program the students pursue a core course of study consisting of 40 credits spread across two courses each in the main areas of Data Science (Design, Value, Systems, Analytics). The core also includes a specialized mathematics series that are tailored to the needs of the program. In addition to the core courses students select one or two concentrations populated with elective courses. The concentrations come in two general forms, a further exploration of one of the areas (e.g. a concentration in analytics would go further into machine learning) or an academic area outside of the school in partnership with another department (e.g. Astronomy, Physics, or Digital Humanities) [8]. One particular course to note is DS 4022, named \u201cFinal Project\u201d. In this course students will synthesize what they have learned over the entire curriculum. This course is also larger than just the semester in which it is taken. The students will be thinking about how they can use that time all along the way. They will then be given great agency to explore and build a data science project, which for some, will lead to future career opportunites [9].\nLeadership and Teamwork\nIn the rapidly evolving field of Data Science, leadership and teamwork play pivotal roles in driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and ensuring the effective utilization of data-driven insights. Data Science projects inherently involve cross-functional teams with diverse skills ranging from machine learning to domain expertise and engineering. A thoughtful leader is essential to provide a clear vision, set strategic objectives and for navigating ethical considerations and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations.\nAs a result, team based learning is ubiquitous in the program with the majority of classes requiring students to work together and lead projects as core assessments. The completion of a Service Learning project is also a requirement for graduates. This can include tutoring new students, serving as a TA, or actively participating in the various community learning activities in the Charlottesville area. The common thread is that this is a new field that is growing quickly and we all need to work together to shape the present and the future of Data Science for the better.\nAfter Graduation\nPreviously we discussed that most Data Science courses at the undergraduate level are really Computer Science or Statistics courses with a Data Science title. When we discuss the advantage that our graduate will have we focus directly on that fact. In this curriculum there are elements critical to succeeding in Data Science work that are not addressed in those other curricula. The core feature is the fundamental acknowledgement that humans are the beginning and the end of every Data Science endeavor. There is always a person who sets the goals at the start, there is always a person conducting the work along the way, and there is always a person who is impacted by the results of the project. As more and more advances are made in AI the value of the college education will shift more and more towards the graduates ability to make the deliverables fit into the human world.\nIn particular we highlight the lessons in leadership and teamwork. Those themes run across all human endeavors and have specific nuances which must be mastered for every specific field. Data Science is no exception and our curriculum addresses this directly in the Design and Value components.\nAnother critical component is the understanding of the principles of an Established Data Set. That is to say a Data Set which will stand the test of time. Concepts like provenance and licensing, as well as data management and ethical impact are explicitly taught and practiced throughout this curriculum.\nThe final critical differentiator for our graduates is their ability to communicate their results to other humans. Most programs do not teach data presentation and in many places it is pejoratively called a \u201csoft-skill\u201d. This curriculum rejects that premise and through the Design courses students are explicitly trained in the skills required to present work with a foundation in data analysis.\nDS 1001 Foundations of Data Science\nThe Foundations of Data Science course sets the table for the next three years by presenting the field through UVA's easily consumable and understood model. The end result is that students understand potential pathways for study and more importantly can envision themselves walking these pathways through the curriculum and eventually out into the world. This is accomplished through the inclusion of guest lectures, both in and out of academia, applied weekly labs and more traditional lecture sessions. The combination of these three main pedological components provides students with an understanding of the current state of the field and an initial understanding of the depth of each of the four areas. The calendar of the course is such that each area represents a fourth of the class, which is also how the core classes of the major are divided. This sends a clear message that data ethics and data communications are equally valued alongside analytics or systems. This equal balancing creates a wider spectrum of potential interests students can pursue and consequently a wider spectrum of students that will pursue the field, which is one of the main objectives of the course.\nIt is our hope that the structure of the class will be used as a model on other campuses to consider when creating \u201cIntroductory\u201d type classes. The approach could also be pushed down into the K-12 school system, as the topics and concepts being presented do not assume prior knowledge of the field. The course also uses a series of purposeful and contemporary design approaches, which are detailed below.\nPedagogical Techniques\nIn the following subsections we will describe several pedagogical techniques that are incorporated into DS 1001, indicating why they were selected, and sharing details of their implementation. The techniques we have chosen to highlight here are not an exhaustive list but rather most critical for the success of the students in the class. At the highest level each was chosen to help us achieve the prime directive of our course design, \u201cany student can enroll and excel\u201d. The techniques detailed here are Specifications Grading, Active Learning in Lectures, Active Learning Labs with gamification, Team Teaching, and Enhanced Student Agency.\nSpecifications Grading\nWhen constructing this course we needed to select a grading system that fit our design principles. A major component of Data Science work is that you must complete and finish your work for it to have value. If the analytics component is in place it is of no value without the systems solution to deliver it. As a result we selected a grading system that focuses on completion of projects rather than on accumulation of points. The point system, pedagogically referred to as ", "think-pair-share": "re well suited to addressing both of these objectives [12]. The downside of most active learning exercises is that they take more time and more engagement from the instructor. Fortunately neither of this is a problem for this course design.\nGiven the survey and introductory nature of the course there is no objective to \u201ccover\u201d as many topics as possible. Rather the goal is to land a few key questions and ideas at a deep level. This permits ample time. In addition the team teaching nature of the class, elaborated on below, helps to spread the work out and not overburden the instructors.\nActive Learning Labs with Gamification\nThis course is designed with a lab component. Students enrolled in DS 1001 simultaneously enroll in a lab section. It is fully integrated with the lecture portion of the course and labs are delivered in sequence with the material in the lecture portion of the course. In these lab sections students are given time to explore practical examples of the topics discussed in lecture. A key feature of these labs is the use of gamification.\nMany children's games, such as Battleship or Mastermind, are elementary puzzles based directly on principles taught in the lecture portion of the class. When the students play the games with each other in the lab period they naturally ask questions about how the game works and what strategies will be the most sucessfull. The students are able to explore the topics from class in a self-directed way and find solutions to the puzzles presented by the games by tapping into the knowledge they gained in class [13] [14]. (As a side-note: some distinguish between", "game based learning": "for our purposes here we use them interchangeably).\nTeam Teaching\nA fundamental principle of Data Science is that it is a \u201cTeam Sport\u201d. As a result the design of this course was mandated to demonstrate that principle wherever possible. To that end the design and delivery of the course was conducted by a team of instructors in discussion with the wider faculty of the school. During a typical semester the students will interact with: two primary co-instructors, a staff data scientist, the TA for their lab section, four additional professors invited to give guest lectures, and four industry experts invited to give guest lectures.\nThere are several benefits from the team approach. The first is modeling to the students the principles of teamwork in data science. The second is to offer them diverse views and demonstrate that there are many ways to look at an issue. On the backend side the division of labor allows for specialization and reduces the workload on any individual instructor. This allows the instructors to focus on developing individual assignments at a much higher quality than normal. The downside of this approach is the increased time of coordination. This is a real concern and requires the team to function well together.\nEnhanced Student Agency\nThe final design goal that we want to highlight here is the goal of empowering students. The primary mechanism we use is by giving the student agency in the classroom when possible, and at an appropriate level. The most explicit way this is done is by giving the students the choice of which grade they set as their goal. The requirements for each letter grade are mapped onto a specific bundle of assignments. Traditional classrooms mandate completion of every assignment and produce an aggregate score at the end.\nAnother key aspect of student agency are the deep dive assignments. The \u201clook ahead\u201d and \u201ccase study extension\u201d assignments are designed to be deep dives where a student can fully explore an idea. Over the course four of each type are offered for a total of eight assignments. However the", "A": "undle only requires four to be completed. The students can take their own career goals in mind when choosing which assignments to complete. And is this way able to tailor their learning to meet their needs."}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "content": "The field of Data Science has rapidly appeared on university campuses nationwide and is a remarkably young academic field, by some measures only a decade or so old. The next iteration will be the creation of undergraduate programs at likely hundreds of schools across the country, if not the globe, over the next three to five years. The curriculum content of those programs could shape the field for generations, making it imperative that as a community we work together to develop a consensus on what should be first principles for the field. It is in this context that we worked to create the overarching framework (4+1 model), an associated Bachelor of Science curriculum, and a broad introductory course whose goal is to present more accurately the field of Data Science as an independent discipline with unique knowledge and skill requirements. Our hope is that this will trigger a larger conversation, or at a minimum encourage some reflection for those confronted with building or shaping Data Science academic programs."}]}

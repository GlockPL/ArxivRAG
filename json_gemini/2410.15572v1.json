INTRODUCTION", "content": "In the era of globalization, societies worldwide are increasingly characterized by their cultural diversity, with multiple ethnic groups coexisting within a single national framework. This multicultural landscape presents challenges, particularly in preserving the unique identities of minority cultures while promoting their integration into the broader societal context. Among these, the Hakka culture in Taiwan stands out as a poignant example of a rich, yet often underrepresented, ethnic heritage seeking its rightful place in the digital age [1]. The importance of cultural preservation and promotion in such multi-ethnic societies cannot be overstated [2], as it not only safeguards the heritage of minority groups but also enriches the social fabric by fostering mutual understanding and respect among diverse populations. Some tools, such as LLaMA, ChatGPT, and Gemini, has become a groundbreaking instrument in Arts and Humanities in the rapidly evolving technological landscape, enabling novel engagement between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) [3]. However, previous AI models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown limitations in adequately capturing and conveying the nuances of specific cultural narratives [4]. This is primarily due to their reliance on parameterized knowledge, which, while effective for general inquiries, falls short in contexts requiring deep, culturally specific insights. The introduction of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology represents a significant leap forward, promising to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and cultural relevance of AI-driven chatbots by leveraging external databases to supplement the chatbot's responses with accurate and contextually appropriate information [5]. This study merges LLMs with RAG to develop culturally inclusive Hakka chatbots [6]. These advanced models integrate the comprehensive learning capabilities of pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models with a specialized, non-parametric memory system, consisting of a dense vector index filled with Hakka cultural knowledge and dictionaries. By leveraging a neural retriever, these chatbots can access and utilize specific cultural insights, addressing the limitations of LLMs in handling knowledge-intensive tasks and providing more accurate, culturally aware interactions. This innovative approach enhances the chatbots' performance on tasks requiring deep cultural understanding and pioneers a path towards solving the challenges of decision provenance and knowledge updating in AI systems [7]. This study aims to fill these gaps by comprehensively analysing a RAG-enhanced Hakka narrative chatbot's design, implementation, and user perceptions. By doing so, it seeks to contribute to the broader discourse on leveraging advanced AI technologies for cultural preservation and representation, offering new insights into the potential of RAG to bridge the divide between technological"}, {"title": "II. AI BIAS AGAINST MINORITY GROUPS", "content": "Incorporating LLMs into societal applications poses ethical challenges, notably the risk of exacerbating biases in training data. This issue is particularly critical for minorities, as it can lead to biased outcomes and reinforce stereotypes, undermining fairness and causing harm [8]. Sampling bias arises when a dataset disproportionately favours certain instances over others, making it unrepresentative of the broader reality. This form of bias is prevalent across various data collections and significantly impacts the performance and generalization of algorithms [9]. For instance, in low-resource languages and minority cultures, datasets might predominantly include languages and cultural references that are widely recognized or have a larger presence in digital and media landscapes. Consequently, languages and cultures with fewer resources or digital visibility are underrepresented. This underrepresentation can lead to inadequate performance of algorithms in processing, understanding, or generating content related to these low-resource languages and minority cultures. As a result, the learned algorithms may struggle to accurately recognize or produce linguistic and cultural nuances specific to these groups, thereby exacerbating the digital divide and cultural invisibility. Thus, addressing sampling bias is crucial for developing more inclusive and equitable technologies that accurately reflect and serve the diversity of global languages and cultures. Previous research underscores the complex interplay between AI and race, revealing how AI contributes to unequal opportunities for individuals from certain racial backgrounds while also possessing the ability to uncover racial discrimination [10]. The issue of AI bias is particularly detrimental to minority ethnic groups, as it amplifies existing disparities and hampers the fair detection and remediation of racial biases. To address the challenge of biased AI and its adverse effects on minority groups, a multifaceted approach is necessary. This involves enriching training datasets with a broad spectrum of racial representations, developing algorithms to identify and amend biases, and cultivating a development ethos emphasizing ethical practices and inclusivity. By adopting these measures, the goal is to advance AI technologies that are just and reflective of our diverse global community."}, {"title": "III. STRATEGIES FOR RETRIEVAL OF MINORITY LANGUAGES AND CULTURES", "content": "This study explores three strategies to enhance the retrieval of accurate information on minority group languages and cultures by LLMs within conversational AI robots [11]. Initially, the method of utilizing precisely designed prompt words combined with internet resource retrieval is proposed [12]. This approach, leveraging search engines based on accurate and comprehensive keywords, allows for the holistic acquisition of knowledge about minority group languages and cultures. Secondly, the feasibility of applying RAG is discussed. By establishing a dedicated knowledge base for minority group languages and cultures and training it with RAG technology, the system prioritizes fetching data from this knowledge base when queries related to minority group languages and cultures are made. The results are then fed back to the LLM, which subsequently delivers the response to the user in a natural language conversational manner. Thirdly, the paper suggests the continuous collection and organization of language and cultural materials of minority groups. Through training and establishing a specialized LLM, users can directly interact using an LLM tailored to minority group languages and cultures. These three modalities not only aid in improving the precision and quality of responses by LLMs regarding minority group languages and cultures but also provide technical support for the protection and promotion of the heritage of minority group languages and cultures. Implementing these methods effectively fosters the protection of linguistic and cultural diversity while also enhancing the visibility and accessibility of minority group languages and cultures. This offers a new technological pathway for promoting cultural diversity and inclusivity."}, {"title": "IV. PRECISELY DESIGNED PROMPTS", "content": "The prior research has highlighted the critical role of precise, prompt engineering in enhancing the retrieval capabilities of LLMs across diverse fields, including entrepreneurship, art, science, and healthcare [13]. By meticulously designing prompts, it is possible to access more obscure information, circumventing the pitfalls of AI illusions that lead to inaccuracies [14]. This tailored approach to prompt construction ensures that LLMs can produce results that are more precise and profoundly aligned with the inquiry's specific context, thereby mitigating errors associated with AI's interpretative limitations [15]. Incorporating precisely designed prompts combined with Google Web Search into conversational AI chatbots represents a pivotal strategy for enhancing the accurate retrieval of information related to minority languages and cultures. By tailoring prompts to include specific keywords and phrases deeply embedded within the unique contexts of minority cultures, Al systems can leverage Google's vast index of web content to fetch more relevant and culturally nuanced information. This approach broadens the scope of data the AI can draw upon and improves the precision of search results by aligning them more closely with the user's query intent. Such integration facilitates a more informed and context-aware retrieval process, ensuring that chatbots' responses are accurate and resonate with the cultural depth and linguistic subtleties of minority groups. Consequently, this method significantly contributes to overcoming the limitations of traditional AI models, which often struggle with the complexity and diversity inherent in minority languages and cultures, thereby promoting a more inclusive digital landscape."}, {"title": "A. Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "content": "Open Domain Question Answering (ODQA) serves as a pivotal challenge in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), dedicated to generating responses to factual inquiries based on extensive knowledge corpora, without relying on explicitly provided evidence [16]. It plays a crucial role in advancing natural language understanding. Among recent innovations in ODQA [17], RAG stands out for enhancing question-answering capabilities by integrating with external, domain-specific knowledge bases [18]. This technology holds particular promise for amplifying the representation and accessibility of minority cultures within ODQA systems. By leveraging RAG, these systems can significantly improve in delivering precise and contextually relevant information of diverse cultural backgrounds, thereby supporting the broader goal of inclusivity in digital knowledge spaces. Establishing a dedicated knowledge base for minority languages/cultures and training it with RAG technology marks a major advancement in improving the accurate retrieval of minority languages/cultures in AI chatbots. This approach involves compiling a comprehensive repository of linguistic data, cultural nuances, historical contexts, and societal values specific to minority groups. AI chatbots can dynamically retrieve and incorporate this specialized information during conversations by integrating this knowledge base with RAG technology. The RAG framework enhances the chatbot's ability to understand and generate responses deeply rooted in the cultural and linguistic context of the inquiry. This method ensures the generated responses are contextually accurate, culturally respectful, and informative. Training AI chatbots with such a rich, curated knowledge base significantly mitigates the risk of perpetuating stereotypes or overlooking the complexities of minority cultures. As a result, this strategy elevates the user experience by providing more meaningful and relevant interactions. It plays a crucial role in preserving and promoting the richness of minority languages and cultures within the digital domain."}, {"title": "B. LLMs for Minority Group Cultures", "content": "Pre-trained multilingual language models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in handling tasks across multiple languages, significantly enhancing the application of NLP for languages with limited resources [19]. Despite these advancements, certain languages, including Hakka, continue to pose challenges, with current multilingual models struggling to achieve optimal performance [20]. Utilizing machine translation for low-resource to mainstream languages in constructing LLMs risks erasing cultural nuances and omitting minority ethnic groups' culture and knowledge, posing a significant threat to cultural preservation [21]. Establishing LLMs specifically for minority group cultures represents a transformative approach to improving the accurate retrieval of minority languages and cultures in AI chatbots. By developing LLMs trained exclusively on linguistic patterns, cultural references, and historical contexts unique to minority groups, these models become adept at processing and understanding queries related to these specific cultures with high accuracy and sensitivity. This specialized training ensures that the AI chatbots are well-equipped to handle the nuances and complexities inherent in minority languages and cultures, enabling them to generate contextually relevant and culturally informed responses. Such an approach addresses the common challenge of generic LLMs failing to adequately represent the depth and diversity of minority cultures due to a lack of targeted data. By prioritizing the development of culture-specific LLMs, AI technologies can offer more inclusive and respectful interactions, facilitating a digital environment where minority languages and cultures are accurately represented and celebrated. This, in turn, enhances the user experience for individuals seeking information or engagement with these cultures, fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity."}, {"title": "V.

While traditional algorithms like user- and item-based collaborative filtering excel at preference modeling, they struggle with cold start issues, data sparsity, and complex semantics, leading to suboptimal performance for diverse user needs. The rise of deep learning, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offers new opportunities for innovation. By combining collaborative filtering with LLMs, these systems can more effectively capture implicit user preferences and leverage deep text understanding to enhance precision and address challenges like cold start and sparse data[2]. Moreover, recent advancements offer valuable inspiration for improving recommendation systems. Qiming Xu et al.'s [3] explainable AI (XAI) enhances NLP model transparency, aiding interpretability in recommendations. Mujie Sui et al.'s[4] work on outliers, missing data, and hybrid models strengthens model robustness and accuracy. Yuxin Dong et al.'s[5] reinforcement learning tackles complex relationships and imbalanced data, boosting system performance. Xiang Ao et al.'s [6] BoNMF model, integrating multimodal data with neural matrix factorization, demonstrates the benefits of leveraging diverse data types.\nThis paper proposes an enhanced recommendation method that integrates collaborative filtering with LLMs, aiming to harness the strengths of both approaches and build an efficient and intelligent recommendation system. The goal of this research is to design and implement a hybrid architecture that explores strategies for fusing collaborative filtering with LLMs in real-world recommendation scenarios and validate the system's performance in terms of precision, recall, and user satisfaction through experiments. The structure of the paper is as follows: first, we introduce the basic theories and relevant technical background of collaborative filtering and LLMs; then, we design and implement the recommendation system that combines these two technologies; next, we analyze the system's performance through experiments; and finally, we summarize the research findings and discuss future directions."}, {"title": "2 THEORIES AND TECHNOLOGIES OF COLLABORATIVE FILTERING AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS", "content": "Recommendation systems are crucial for improving user experience and driving business growth, with collaborative filtering being a widely used approach. Collaborative filtering predicts user preferences by analyzing similarities between users or items. However, traditional methods face significant challenges in large-scale systems, such as computational complexity, data sparsity, and cold start problems, limiting their practical application. Wen Jun Gu et al.'s[7] approach of combining FinBERT-based sentiment analysis with LSTM for stock prediction, which integrates textual and numerical data to enhance prediction accuracy. Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with collaborative filtering offers a solution to these issues. LLMs excel at semantic understanding and can process multimodal data, including text, images, audio, and video. By combining LLMs with collaborative filtering, the system can extract richer features, addressing data sparsity and improving recommendations, especially in cold start scenarios where user interaction data is limited [8]."}, {"title": "3 DESIGN OF THE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM COMBINING COLLABORATIVE FILTERING AND LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS", "content": "3.1 System Architecture Design\nThis architecture illustrates the design of a recommendation system that combines Collaborative Filtering (CF) with Neural Networks to address challenges such as cold start problems, data sparsity, and the need for improved recommendation accuracy and diversity. By incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) alongside CF, the system enhances user preference modeling and captures complex user-item interactions through neural networks, further improving recommendation performance[14].Shaoxuan Sun et al.'s [15] use of regression models and cross-validation to evaluate model performance provides a solid foundation for ensuring the robustness of our hybrid model across different datasets and scenarios."}, {"title": "3.2 Algorithm Fusion Strategies", "content": "In recommendation systems, the fusion of collaborative filtering algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) requires careful consideration of how to effectively combine user behavior data with textual semantic information to achieve more accurate and personalized recommendations [20]. By integrating the user-item interaction modeling of collaborative filtering with the semantic feature extraction of LLMs, the system can leverage the strengths of both in recommendation scenarios [21]. Below are key algorithm fusion strategies, along with mathematical formulations for their implementation.In traditional collaborative filtering algorithms, the predicted score for user u on item i is typically represented as:\n$\\hat{Y}_{ui} = P_u \\cdot Q_i$\nwhere $\\hat{Y}_{ui}$ is the predicted score, $P_u$ is the user's latent feature vector, and $Q_i$ is the item's latent feature vector. This formula computes the similarity between the user and item by taking the dot product of their vectors, resulting in a predicted score. However, this approach has limitations as it relies solely on historical interaction data and ignores content information and user textual expressions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Large Language Model $F_{LLM} (i)$, which extracts the semantic features of item i based on its textual data (such as descriptions and reviews). These features provide valuable semantic information about the item. After incorporating LLM, the score prediction formula can be extended as follows:\n$\\hat{Y}_{ui} = P_u \\cdot Q_i + \\alpha \\cdot F_{LLM}(i)$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter used to balance the influence of collaborative filtering and LLM. This formula shows that the recommendation result is determined not only by user-item interactions (the collaborative filtering part) but also by item semantic features (the LLM part), improving the recommendation accuracy.The cold start problem is a persistent challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when dealing with new users or new items, where traditional collaborative filtering methods often struggle to provide accurate recommendations. To address this issue, the powerful text processing capabilities of LLMs can be utilized to generate valuable semantic features for new items. In this strategy, the system no longer relies on users' historical behavior but instead recommends items directly based on their textual descriptions [22].Suppose the textual description of item i is $T_i$, and through LLM processing, we obtain the item's text embedding vector $E_i$:\n$E_i = F_{LLM}(T_i)$\nFor cold start items, the score prediction formula for user u can be further extended as:\n$\\hat{Y}_{ui} = P_u \\cdot E_i$ (4)\nThis method embeds the item's textual features into the user's latent feature space, enabling the system to recommend relevant items to users even when there is no historical interaction data. This strategy significantly alleviates the cold start problem, especially when there is insufficient historical data, allowing the system to provide accurate recommendations based on the semantic information of items. To ensure that the fusion strategy between collaborative filtering and LLM performs optimally in the recommendation system, the entire model needs to be trained jointly. During this process, the model's loss function is designed to minimize the difference between predicted and actual scores. The loss function typically uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) as follows:\n$L = \\sum_{(u,i)\\in D}(\\hat{Y}_{ui} - y_{ui})^2$ (5)"}, {"title": "4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS", "content": "In this experiment, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering with large language models (LLMs) across different datasets. We tested the performance of various models in multiple experimental scenarios, including traditional collaborative filtering models, pure LLM-based recommendation models, and the hybrid model proposed in this study [25]. The experimental data were mainly sourced from the MovieLens and Amazon Product Review Datasets, with proper dataset splitting to ensure each model was tested under the same conditions for a fair comparison.The experiment process was divided into the following steps:\nData Preparation: The MovieLens dataset contains 100,000 user movie ratings, while the Amazon Product Review Dataset includes over 500,000 user reviews of products. To ensure fairness, we performed standard dataset splitting: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Each model was trained and tested on both datasets to assess its performance in different scenarios. Model Training: The collaborative filtering model employed matrix factorization to embed users and items into a latent vector space. The LLM model encoded textual information using a pre-trained Transformer architecture to generate semantic embeddings for the items. The hybrid model combined the ratings generated by collaborative filtering with the textual features extracted by the LLM, using weighted fusion to produce the final recommendation scores. We experimented with different weight parameters $\\alpha$ to adjust the contribution of collaborative filtering and LLM to find the best combination strategy.Evaluation Metrics: We used four main metrics to assess model performance: Precision, Recall, Coverage, and User Satisfaction. Precision and Recall reflect the accuracy of the recommendations, Coverage evaluates the diversity of the recommendations, and User Satisfaction was rated by simulating user interactions with the recommended items."}, {"title": "5 CONCLUSION", "content": "This study demonstrates that combining collaborative filtering with Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively enhances the performance of recommendation systems. The experimental results show that the hybrid model outperforms individual models in terms of precision, recall, coverage, and user satisfaction, particularly excelling in handling cold start and data sparsity issues. By adjusting the weight parameter $\\alpha$, the system achieves the optimal balance between diversity and accuracy, proving the advantage of combining collaborative filtering with LLMs. Future research can further optimize the fusion strategy to adapt to a broader range of scenarios."}]}

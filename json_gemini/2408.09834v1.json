In the past it uses reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm to optimize the LLM policy to align with these preferences and not to draft too far from the original model. Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed to solve the alignment problem with a simplified RL-free method. Using preference pairs of chosen and reject data, DPO models the relative log probability as implicit reward function and optimize LLM policy using a simple binary cross entropy objective directly. DPO is quite straight forward and easy to be understood. It perform efficiently and well in most cases. In this article, we analyze the working mechanism of \u03b2 in DPO, disclose its syntax difference between RL algorithm and DPO, and understand the potential shortage brought by the DPO simplification. With these insights, we propose MinorDPO, which is better aligned to the original RL algorithm, and increase the stability of preference optimization process.", "sections": [{"title": "Background", "content": "Recent LLM trained on very large datasets are extremely powerful in understanding human queries and providing surprisingly reasoning ability. Traditional industry like finance also begin to try using LLM in its business, but require a high demand of accuracy on number, entity, event and etc., which brings in much higher requirements on the preference alignment quality. In the past RLHF establish a paradigm for the alignment work, which use reward model and reinforcement learning like Schulman et al. (2017) to optimize the LLM model after a supervised fine-tuning. Rafailov et al. (2023) present a simplified algorithm DPO which directly optimizes the LLM with a simple cross entropy classification objective based on the preference pair data. DPO models the relative log probability as an implicit reward function and derived a closed objective form. Its concept is quite straight froward, easy to understand, and appropriate for quick start work. Meanwhile we have also found DPO is fragile in some data distribution, which need a careful tuning to avoid an optimization crash.\nDPO update the relative log probability of the preference pair data, using a dynamic sample-level importance weight to prevent the model degeneration. The key factor is the hyper-parameter \u03b2 used in DPO algorithm. Rafailov et al. (2023) claim \u03b2 accounting for the strength of the KL constraints. In this paper we analyze the internal working mechanism of DPO on how it optimize model, clarify the slightly different syntax of \u03b2 between RL Eq. 1 and DPO Eq. 2, to know the shortage DPO bring in.\nOur main contribution is that we give a comprehensive analysis of the \u03b2 mechanism and propose an improved loss function Minor DPO Eq. 6 based on the analysis.

Then LLM is trained through RL algorithm like PPO (Schulman et al. (2017)) to maximize the learned reward on the LLM while maintaining the discrepancy between the optimized LLM and the original LLM to prevent model degeneration.\nDPO(Rafailov et al. (2023)) introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF and allow to solve the standard RLHF problem using a simplified solution with only a cross entropy classification loss based on the preference data pair directly. It's simpler to implement, requires less compute resource, and can fine-tune LLM to align with human as well as RL algorithm. Rafailov et al. (2024) derive that DPO is token-level MDP that satisfies the Bellman equation and works as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm in a theoretical way.\nThere are several other variants that optimize alignment objective based on the preference sample directly. Some variants contain a reference model while some variants are reference-free.\nIPO(Azar et al. (2023)) identify that DPO may be prone to over-fitting in situations where the preference probability of the chosen over the reject sample is close to 1 and propose Identity Preference Optimization based on preference data pair.\nKTO(Ethayarajh et al. (2024)) propose HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generation, instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preference. It's able to train with only chosen samples, which is useful in some scenarios.\nDPOP(Pal et al. (2024)) identify that DPO may lead to degenerate when the preference data pair is close. It uses a theoretic analysis, prove both reward/chosen and reward/reject grows up to negative value with a high probability, and propose a fix by adding an additional non-linear reward on the chosen sample yw, somehow like adding an extra SFT loss conditional on the relative log probability distance of the chosen sample yw between the optimized LLM and the reference LLM.\nPCO(Adolphs et al. (2022)) argue that method such as unlikelihood which simply push down the probability of negative tokens may inadvertently push up the probability of low quality or rare tokens for that sequence position. It proposes pairwise cringe loss which use a sampled top-k token, and instead of push down the probability of the original negative token, it increases the probability of the sampled token and thus decrease the original negative token indirectly. The pairwise cringe loss doesn't use a ref model to constraint the discrepancy that the optimized model may draft from the original model.\nSimPO(Meng et al. (2024)) propose a simpler approach, it's reference-free and use the average log probability of the sequence as an implicit reward, and introduce a target reward margin to the Bradley-Terry objective.\nOrpo (Hong et al. (2024)) propose a variant of SFT by using odds ratio-based penalty to the conven-tional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss for the reject samples. It's also reference-free.\nBeyond the RL and DPO variants, Nakano et al. (2022), Askell et al. (2021) Cobbe et al. (2021) explore best-of-n sampling to improve large language model generation by selecting the best response based on the human preference rewards among n sampled responses. RRHF(Yuan et al.

The additional loss shall bring rewards/chosen $log(\\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(Y_w|x)}{\\pi_{ref} (Y_w|x)}) \u2265 0$ for some data distribution. while it also brings an additional hyper parameter that needs to be tuned with the corresponding \u03b2 value.\nBesides rewards/chosen grows up to negative, in Adolphs et al. (2022), Jiang et al. (2022) they argue that method such as unlikelihood which simply push down the probability of reject tokens may inadvertently push up the probability of low quality or rare tokens for that sequence position, because there is no control over that effect. We have observed the same problem in our experiments, with a slightly larger learning rate like 5e \u2013 6 to 1e \u2013 5, the DPO optimized model may start to generate repeated token, or some unwanted symbol token in the answer, which we believe is caused by the over penalty. Although with an appropriate small learning rate, the DPO optimized model works, we still believe if they're enough training steps, DPO may still crash the model when the accumulated penalty on the reject samples surpasses a certain threshold.\nIn Adolphs et al. (2022) it uses a sampled token and instead of pushing down the probability of the original reject token, it increases the probability of the sampled token. Compared to the standard cringe loss, it uses the preference pair and get a dynamic margin between logp(yw|x) and logp(ylx) to control the pair cringe loss. This method brings several hyper-parameters to tune, and in our experiment it may over-pull up the sampled token probability and cause the optimized model generate repeat token."}, {"title": "Minor DPO reject penalty to improve training robustness", "content": "They're several assumptions that we found really important and the our solution is based on those assumptions.\nthe Eq.1 suggest that the \u03c0\u03bf should not far from tref, for both yw and y\u0131, and it use an explicit KL loss to present the constraints, and use \u03b2 to control the constraints strength.\ntref in DPO is quite important and is the key factor to prevent over optimization.

DPOP propose an addition SFT on the chosen sample, while we believe the degeneration is caused by the over penalty on the reject samples from DPO, and propose a solution that decrease the penalty, to make it more consistent with the original RL method.\nFor training settings, we use Qwen1.5-7B-Chat(Bai et al.

For the preference sample pair, normally we just prefer the chosen samples over the reject samples, but it doesn't mean the reject samples are totally wrong. The symmetric form of increase on the chosen sample and decrease on the reject sample introduce too much penalty over the reject sample. DPO uses a sample level dynamic coefficient to ease the problem but doesn't solve it completely. We propose MinorDPO that break the symmetry by reducing the decrease on the reject samples. In this article we only focus on the over penalty problem thus only compare three methods: DPO, DPOP and MinorDPO using the MetaMath datasets. There may be more methods and more datasets to be tested in the future. We believe DPO is an elegant and efficient base to start with and investigate in for the preference alignment work. MinorDPO is an improvement on DPO and doesn't bring in additional hyper-parameter. With virtually no tuning of hyper-parameter, it performs same or better than DPO and other DPO variants.\nAs in our test, MinorDPO can accept higher learning rate. MinorDPO decrease the penalty over reject samples and thus may introduce under-fit problem for some data distributions, so an appropriate higher learning rate may help fixing it.\nAnother important work is how to prevent over-fit on the learning datasets. We know DPO and DPO variants are sensitive to the \u03b2 and learning rate, so tuning these two hyper-parameters may help. Inspired by B-free rewards and margin, We think there may exist some training metrics that can be used to quantify whether training is sufficient or not, and thus those metrics can be used inside DPO/MinorDPO in some way to solve the over-fit problem."}]}

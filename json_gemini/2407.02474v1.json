However, in affective science, emotions are often represented as multi-dimensional. In this paper, we propose to adopt a Circumplex Model of emotion by mapping emotions into a two-dimensional spectrum of valence and arousal. We show how one can derive a valence and arousal signal from an agent's expected free energy, relating arousal to the entropy of posterior beliefs and valence to utility less expected utility. Under this formulation, we simulate artificial agents engaged in a search task. We show that the manipulation of priors and object presence results in commonsense variability in emotional states.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "Emotions are internal states that influence behavior and cognition [1].

While these models address elements such as valence, they do not provide comprehensive accounts. Notably, the dimension of arousal has been largely overlooked. Our formulation aims to address this gap by integrating both valence and arousal into a more comprehensive model of emotions under active inference.\nJoffily and Coricelli [9] cast valence as the interaction between the first- and second-order time derivatives of free energy, serving as an indicator of emotional well-being. In their framework, emotional valence provides feedback on an agent's learning process. A rapid decrease in free energy, indicating increasingly accurate predictions, is associated with happiness and suggests that the agent should update its models more quickly by increasing the learning rate. Conversely, negative valence suggests that a slower learning rate is appropriate."}, {"title": "2 From Free Energy to a Circumplex Model of Emotion", "content": "The Circumplex Model of emotion organises emotional states along two dimensions: valence and arousal. We hypothesize that both dimensions can be derived from an active inference agent's free energy levels."}, {"title": "2.1 Active Inference", "content": "Active inference casts perception and action as Bayesian inference [12], where an agent entertains a generative model of its environment and perceives and acts in order to minimize free energy, as defined below, with respect to this model. In general, such an agent's generative model can be written as the joint probability distribution over states s and observations o. Minimizing free energy, then, entails finding the approximate posterior distribution Q(so):\n$\\min_{Q(s,o)} F = DKL[Q(s|o)||P(s|o)] \u2013 \\log P(o)$\n$\\ = -EQ(s|0) [\\log P(o, s)] \u2013 H[Q(s|o)]$\n$\\ = DKL[Q(s|0))||P(s)] \u2013 EQ(s|0) [\\log P(o|s)]$\nEffectively, by minimizing free energy, an agent aims to find the model that maximizes accuracy with minimal complexity, which is effectively maximizing (a lower bound) on the model (log) evidence.\nTo interact with the environment, an agent in addition also needs to select a sequence of actions or policy to execute. In active inference, agents select policies that minimize expected free energy G:\n$P(\\pi) = \\sigma(\u2212G(\\pi))$, with\n$G(\\pi) = \\sum_{T=t+1}^{T} Ep(o,\\pi)[D_{KL}[Q(s_T|o_T,\\pi)||Q(s_T|\\pi)]] - E_{Q(o_T|\\pi)}[\\log P(o_T|C)]$"}, {"title": "2.2 From Free Energy to Valence", "content": "We depart from the approach of Joffily and Coricelli [9], who collapse features of valence and arousal when differentiating emotional states by exclusively computing valence from variational free energy and its time derivatives.

Allostasis refers to an internal state of an organism which optimally predicts incoming messages in an effort to maintain homeostasis in a dynamic environment. To achieve a homeostatic state, an active agent needs to move towards an allostatic one, which amounts to updating model parameters to reduce the uncertainty of its posterior beliefs [17]. The empirical relationship between arousal, the amygdala, uncertainty, and the imperative to update model parameters to achieve allostasis motivates casting the entropy H of a posterior distribution as an index of arousal in a dimensional model of emotion. More formally, arousal (A) becomes:\n$A = EQ(s|o) [log Q(s|o)] = H[Q(s|0)]$"}, {"title": "2.4 Transformation to an Active Inference Emotional State Space", "content": "To ground valence and arousal in a Circumplex Model, we transform the Cartesian coordinates (V, A) into the following polar coordinates.\nr = radius = \u221aV2 + A2\n\u03b8angle = tan\u22121 (AV )\nAfter this transformation, we can represent agents' emotional states in a circle, spacing emotions by both degree and distance from origin, i.e., distance from neutral. The horizontal axis represents the valence dimension, ranging from sad (negative valence) on the left to happy (positive valence) on the right, while the vertical axis represents degree of arousal, ranging from high arousal/uncertainty (top) to low arousal/certainty (bottom). The distance from origin represents the \"intensity\u201d of the emotion (degree of affective response). The co-occurrence of valence and arousal results in the varying degrees on the circle with different emotion labels [18]. The cited emotion labels are standardly associated with these orientations on Circumplex models.\nFigure 1 shows an example plot of the Circumplex Model in question. The blue trajectory describes the search sequence of a simulated agent who wants to find an arbitrary object and has a precise prior on where to find it.

The agent has two state factors, one for tracking its own location, and one for maintaining a belief on the object's location.

At each time step, the agent can select a location to visit, but it will only transition to the next location if this is connected to its current location.

We conducted these simulations to see whether and how the agent conducts emotional regulation. In Scenario 4, in addition to a dimension for every location, the agent's state factor has a 'not here' bin. Invoking this factor means that the agent expects not to see the object at any of the locations it can visit. In Scenario 5, the agent does not have this dimension, hence it has a structural prior that the object should always be at one of the locations. This has some interesting consequences for the emotional states the agent visits, as illustrated in the contrast between the circumplex plots in Figure 5."}, {"title": "5 Discussion", "content": "In this paper, we derived a Circumplex Model of emotion by associating both valence and arousal with the parameters of free energy. Simulation studies provided evidence that our model enables the sound ascription of anthropomorphic emotional state trajectories to a simulated agent performing basic search tasks. These simulations further demonstrate that the inclusion of arousal as well as valence dimensions facilitates the commonsense understanding of emotion, even in simple scenarios.\nFirst, comparing Scenarios 1 (uniform prior) and 3 (incorrect prior), upon finding the object, both agents enter equivalently positively valenced states, but the agent in Scenario 3 finishes considerably less aroused. The emotional trajectory of the agent in Scenario 3, involving a mood swing from a highly negatively valenced state (anger) to a region of neutral valence, could not be described in terms of valence alone.\nSecond, the agent in Scenario 3 became successively less aroused before finding the object. A description of emotional state in terms of valence alone would not capture the fact that after having a prior expectation violated, an agent may return to a state of alertness, which dwindles to resignation as time progresses.\nThird, Scenario 5, in which an agent's object presence prior is incorrect, is telling. It shows that on our theory, successful regulation of emotion is not inevitable for any active inference agent, but rather depends on the fundamental soundness of one's model of the world. Rigid priors that cannot change in the face of evidence may put successful allostasis, and thus optimal homeostasis and a correspondingly calm emotional state measured in terms of arousal or entropy, out of reach.\nThis work faces a couple of key limitations. One is that the scenarios are simple and the range of emotion evidenced is correspondingly narrow. Another is that our findings are not benchmarked against human data. Instead, we rely on face validity to make sense of the attribution of emotional states to simulated agents. A target for future experimental work is to measure how emotion impacts behavior in inference and learning, rather than merely characterizing it, following past work on emotional inference (e.g., [9]).\nOther future research will explore the temporal dimension of emotion and emotional state attribution. Joffily and Coricelli [9], for example, distinguish between factive and epistemic emotions, i.e., beliefs that a state of affairs obtains, yielding an emotion such as disappointment, versus uncertain beliefs, yielding an emotion such as hope. This distinction may be naturally accounted for in terms of an agent's past or current and anticipated emotional experiences.\nAdditionally, although we normalized the arousal component when transforming to polar coordinates, the raw radius of the polar coordinates may correspond to the intensity of an emotion. In line with our proposed model, some research suggests that the intensity of emotion is distinct from arousal [19]. An account of emotional intensity may have implications for other cognitive processes, such as event segmentation in an anthropomorphic account of episodic memory in simulated agents, as more intense emotional experiences are more likely to be encoded and recalled [20].\nFuture work may explore emotions among simulated agents in social contexts. For example, finely-grained emotional inference of an agent's own emotions, as well as possession of a theory of mind, are prerequisites for empathy. Because our"}]}

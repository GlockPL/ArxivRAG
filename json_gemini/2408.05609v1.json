Here, we consider an emerging opportunity to reduce carbon emissions: the growing adoption of semi-autonomous vehicles, which can be programmed to mitigate stop-and-go traffic through intelligent speed commands and, thus, reduce emissions. But would such dynamic eco-driving move the needle on climate change? A comprehensive impact analysis has been out of reach due to the vast array of traffic scenarios and the complexity of vehicle emissions. Such an analysis would require careful modeling of many traffic scenarios and solving an eco-driving problem at each one of them - a challenge that has been out of reach for previous studies. We address this challenge with large-scale scenario modeling efforts and by using multi-task deep reinforcement learning with a carefully designed network decomposition strategy. We perform an in-depth prospective impact assessment of dynamic eco-driving at 6,011 signalized intersections across three major US metropolitan cities, simulating a million traffic scenarios. Overall, we find that vehicle trajectories optimized for emissions can cut city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11-22%, without harming throughput or safety, and with reasonable assumptions, equivalent to the national emissions of Israel and Nigeria, respectively. We find that 10% eco-driving adoption yields 25%-50% of total reduction, and nearly 70% of the benefits come from 20% of intersections, suggesting near-term implementation pathways. However, the composition of this high-impact subset of intersections varies considerably across different adoption levels, with minimal overlap, calling for careful strategic planning for eco-driving deployments. Moreover, the impact of eco-driving, when considered jointly with projections of vehicle electrification, hybrid vehicle adoption, and travel growth, remains significant. More broadly, this work paves the way for large-scale analysis of traffic externalities, such as time, safety, and air quality, and the potential impact of solution strategies.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "For interrupted traffic flow dynamics, dynamic eco-driving has attracted significant attention in recent decades Mintsis et al.

Owing to advances in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies and the standardization of the signal phase and timing (SPaT) messages, these technologies have facilitated the research of dynamic eco-driving, especially near signalized intersections, where traffic flow is persistently interrupted Mintsis et al.

While they often study different traffic settings, Mintsis et al. Mintsis et al. (2020) show an average eco-driving benefit of 17%, with a standard deviation of 11% by considering 21 past studies. While this highlights the potential of eco-driving, these studies often consider only a few factors that are known to have an impact on eco-driving benefits, making the shown benefits scenario/traffic setting specific. Based on the literature, we identify nearly 33 factors that affect eco-driving benefits. We refer the reader to Appendix 10.3 for more details on these factors and their known impact.\nMoreover, most eco-driving studies focus on devising better eco-driving strategies (e.g., how to eco-drive). Such studies often take three forms: 1) analytical approaches, 2) simulation approaches, and 3) field experiments Mintsis et al. (2020). Analytical approaches often focus on analyzing the eco-driving problem from a theoretical point of view by analyzing properties such as the stability of the system under certain eco-driving strategies Coppola et al. (2022). On the other hand, simulation-based approaches are used to test the potential of new eco-driving strategies and also to conduct impact assessments. However, one of the major limitations of such work is the lack of consideration of many factors that affect eco-driving benefitsBarkenbus (2010); Jayawardana and Wu (2022); Meng and Cassandras (2020); Mintsis et al. (2020). Furthermore, for simplicity and tractability of eco-driving control optimization scope, most of these studies analyze a few intersections under simplified traffic conditions (e.g., uniform inflow rates) Sun et al. (2020); Yang et al. (2016, 2020). A few studies that focus on multiple intersections often solely focus on the generalization of eco-driving strategies and rely on synthetically generated traffic scenarios while not considering the impact assessment requirements Jayawardana et al. (2024). Finally, field studies are also conducted to demonstrate the benefits of eco-driving and to validate the applicability of eco-driving strategies Hao et al. (2018); Mintsis et al. (2017); Stahlmann et al. (2018). However, these studies are often confined to small regions (e.g., a few intersections) due to the logistical difficulties of conducting such experiments at scale Mintsis et al.

However, they often remain limited to specific scenarios Ault and Sharon (2021); Wang et al. (2021b), primarily due to a focus on proof of concepts rather than comprehensive assessments of proposed methods. Additionally, modeling multiple intersections can be prohibitively expensive, requiring data fusion from various sources and handling missing data.\nHowever, our requirements for modeling intersection scenarios are objectively and strategically different from previous work, necessitating us to develop our own datasets. First, we are neither presenting an eco-driving proof of concept nor attempting to answer how to do eco-driving. Our goal is to analyze the impact of eco-driving to answer the question of whether to eco-drive. Such questions can not be answered by analyzing merely a few intersection scenarios. Unless we have a representative set of intersection scenarios, merely relying on a select intersection could lead to evaluation overfitting where the insights extracted from a few scenarios do not generalize to the class of scenarios Jayawardana et al. (2022); Whiteson et al. (2011).\nFurthermore, we must avoid overfitting to a specific region in our impact assessment Gately et al. (2015). While there are popular intersection datasets available for Manhattan Island in New York Wei et al. (2019), using them could lead to regional overfitting. Manhattan Island exhibits distinct spatial and temporal traffic dynamics due to its block-oriented road network. Insights drawn from an impact assessment solely based on these intersections would not be effective in generalizing to other cities or regions.\nAnother option is to use synthetic datasets, which are easier to generate Li et al. (2022). However, impact assessments based on these datasets are not particularly meaningful as they may not reflect the real-world intersection distributions and may contain oversimplified scenarios Feng et al.

(2020). Therefore, many studies adopt a network decomposition from the full network to the intersection level and optimize vehicle trajectories at individual intersections. While this has been a standard practice, it has to be performed carefully as isolated optimization of intersection-level behaviors can cause unexpected adverse events (e.g., intersection queue spillback from one intersection to another) at the network level. In this work, we adopt the same network decomposition strategy and take careful precautions to isolate the effects of the changed vehicle behaviors on each individual intersection.\nIn light of this, consider a region comprised of traffic scenario variations $\\Phi$ where $|\\Phi|$ is very large (e.g., millions of individual signalized intersection scenarios). With the network decomposition strategy, traffic scenario variations are stemming at the intersection level (e.g., changes in traffic flow, temperature, etc.). Let $\\pi^\\phi := (\\pi_\\phi)_{\\phi \\in \\Phi}$ denote the set of eco-driving control laws. Similarly, let $\\pi^o := (\\pi^o_\\phi)_{\\phi \\in \\Phi}$ denote the baseline (status quo driving).

However, this should be done with minimal impact on the travel times of vehicles. Given a vehicle dynamics model $x_i$ for guided semi-autonomous vehicle i and $y_j$ for human-driven vehicle j and the traffic signal timing plan p of the signalized intersection being assessed, we formulate the optimal-control problem in discrete time-space as follows,"}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In the following subsections, we detail our approach to assessing the impact of eco-driving at signalized intersections by describing our approach to scenario modeling, solving eco-driving control, and how we perform impact assessment.

On the other hand, exhaustive yet realistic modeling offers superfluous detail that is redundant in decision-making (e.g., temperature impact on eco-driving at a fine-grained scale). Our approach seeks a representative subset of scenarios"}, {"title": "Eco-driving Control", "content": "Eco-driving control involves devising a set of eco-driving strategies for the representative scenario set $\\Phi\u0384$. Eco-driving control for one million scenarios is a challenging task. Traditional methods like dynamic programming are computationally limiting Doan et al. (2018), while heuristics are often suboptimal Katsaros et al. (2011). Trajectory optimizations are limited by the complexity of required vehicle dynamics models, particularly due to inter-vehicle dynamics and environmental variability introduced by many factors we consider Yang et al. (2016).\nMeanwhile, recent studies have shown the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning in complex control tasks Bellemare et al. (2020); Silver et al. (2017); Wurman et al. (2022). Neural vehicle control using deep reinforcement learning Jayawardana and Wu (2022); Wu et al. (2021); Yan et al. (2022), which can handle diverse traffic scenarios without manual fine-tuning, is also gaining popularity. However, training such a policy for each scenario is impractical due to the number of scenarios. Training a unified policy is complex due to multifaceted factors and\nthe induced complex expectation Zhang and Yang (2021). Learning both discrete lane changes and continuous longitudinal accelerations presents optimization challenges, demanding diverse exploration strategies and distinct neural network representations.\nThus, we introduce a custom training method involving three key steps: 1) similar scenario partitioning, 2) within partition multi-task deep reinforcement learning (MT-DRL), and 3) rule-based lane changes and a hierarchical policy selection strategy to accommodate lane changes. Below, we detail each of these steps in detail.\nSimilar scenario partitioning: In this step, our aim is to partition scenarios by their similarities, allowing us to train separate MT-DRL policies for each partition. This strategy is inspired by the mixture of expert architecture widely used in real-world systems with generalization requirements Masoudnia and Ebrahimpour (2014). It can reduce scenario diversity within a partition and help reduce training complexity. While each scenario is defined by many factors, we only utilize intersection geometry and traffic flow-specific features as partitioning features because they strongly influence policy behaviors.\nHowever, since signalized intersections lack rotational invariance, comparing them for similarity is challenging. Therefore, we break down the intersection environment into non-conflicting pairs of incoming and outgoing approaches. This has added advantages. It accelerates training by simulating fewer vehicles and improves training stability by alleviating credit assignment challenges Zhou et al. (2020). Further, it has no impact on modeling realism due to the decoupling nature of traffic signals (e.g., northbound traffic and eastbound traffic do not collide). These selected pairs, along with the ghost approaches connected to them, thus become our training environments and are illustrated in Figure 7.\nThe training environments are then partitioned into 28 partitions, considering the semi-autonomous vehicle penetration level, lane count, and traffic signal phase count as partition features. However, the environments in each partition may not form a uniform distribution. This may make environments sampled in consecutive training iterations differ significantly, requiring adaptive learning strategies. To overcome this, we adopt a synthetic environment distribution $\\Phi_T$ derived from the full scenario set for each partition with a uniform distribution for policy training as illustrated in Figure 2. Additional details about the training environment distributions can be found in Appendix 10.7.\nWithin partition MT-DRL: Training an MT-DRL policy per partition involves solving an eco-driving contextual Markov Decision Process (cMDP) where each scenario is an MDP within the cMDP. Furthermore, MDPs within a cMDP can take on either single-agent or multi-agent forms. We adopt multi-agent control, necessitating implicit or explicit coordination among controlled vehicles for better emission reductions. Consequently, each MDP in the cMDP is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)."}, {"title": "Impact Assessment", "content": "Impact assessment involves leveraging the trained eco-driving policies to assess the benefits of eco-driving in the representative scenario set $\\Phi'$. Let $\\Pi$ be the trained policy set for all 28 partitions. We further employ the zero-shot generalizability of these policies to conduct the final impact assessment. In particular, for a given semi-autonomous vehicle penetration level, we have seven partitions by varying the lane count and phase count. Recall that we denote each partition as $\\Psi_i$ where i $\\in$ {1,...,7} when the semi-autonomous vehicle penetration level is given. Let $\\Pi'$ = $[(\\pi^j_\\psi, \\pi^k_\\psi)_{i \\in \\{1,...,7\\}} \\cup \\pi^o ]$ be the subset of trained policies for all seven partitions under a given semi-autonomous vehicle penetration level and the status quo driving baseline control policy $\\pi^o$.\nFor a given scenario $\\phi$ belonging to one of the seven clusters, we seek the best-performing policy $\\pi^*$ as follows,\nThe function $g(\\cdot)$ is defined as,\nsuch that $f(\\pi, \\phi)$ denoting the function that captures the $CO_2$ emission for the scenario $\\phi$ under the control law $\\pi$ and M is large enough constant to indicate the policy $\\pi^k$ is invalid due to any of the network decomposition constraint violations as listed in Equations 6, 7, and 8. If any of the constraints are not satisfied, we default to the status quo driving baseline control policy $\\pi^o$. Below, we describe how we check for these constraint violations.\nControl active intersection throughput constraint: To check if the control policy $\\pi^k$ satisfies the throughput requirement, we compare its throughput with the status quo driving baseline $\\pi^o$ throughput. If $n_k$ is the throughput of $\\pi^k$ and $n_o$ is their throughput of $\\pi^o$, then the constraint is satisfied if $n_k \\geq \\eta n_o$.\nFollowing intersection queue length to lane length ratio constraint: If the eco-driving increases the throughput of the intersections by smoothing traffic flow, it is imperative to ensure that additional throughput is bearable by the intersection immediately ahead of the control active intersection. To ensure this, we leverage the average vehicle queue length to lane length ratio of each approach as it indicates how many additional vehicles the approach can accommodate without congestion in the equilibrium state. In particular, we check if the vehicle inflow to all the control active intersections is increased by r percent (mimicking increased throughput from the preceding intersection), can we ensure that all control active intersections under policy $\\pi^k$ have vehicle queue length to lane length ratio $m_{i,k} < \\tau$ where $\\tau$ is a hyperparameter. When $\\tau < 1$, the lane can accommodate more vehicles. In practice, we find the maximum r with $\\tau$ = 0.3 such that at least 99% of the intersections can accommodate the additional throughput. Once such r is found, all presented analyses will ensure that the following intersection queue length to lane length ratio constraint is satisfied.\nPreceding intersection vehicle waiting time constraint: When eco-driving is performed at the control active intersection, the changed vehicle flow may affect the outflow of the intersection immediately precedes it (e.g., when the vehicles glide at the control active intersection slowing the"}, {"title": "Simulation-based Analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "Experimental setup", "content": "We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Schulman et al.

Notably, a 10% eco-driving adoption can yield 25-50% of the total emission reduction, showcasing a non-linear benefit scaling and greater potential for short-term deployments to gain a majority of total benefits. Importantly, these gains incur no costs to intersection throughput. Additionally, Figure 9 demonstrates consistent emission benefits under different weather conditions across seasons, with minor fluctuations. This emphasizes that eco-driving can yield benefits throughout the year.\nFigure 10 shows the spatial distributions of these emission benefits under different eco-driving adoption levels. The low benefits intersections in Figure 10 can happen due to three reasons. First, eco-driving at those intersections would not yield benefits due to their characteristics (e.g., not enough lane lengths for eco-driving). Second, the benefits of those intersections are defaulted to zero due to network decomposition constraint violation. Third, our MT-DRL policies are suboptimal in these intersections.

The signal ratio denotes the ratio between approach-related phase times and total cycle time. Notably, speed limits, vehicle inflow, and lane lengths significantly impact emission benefits. In particular, when the speed limit and lane length increase, the benefit levels increase. On the other hand, when the inflow increases, the benefit decreases. This explains why the three cities we consider have different benefit levels.

However, Qu et al. Qu et al. (2022) caution that the pre-processing steps may not fully recover the real-world conditions for certain intersections. As such, we acknowledge that our modeling may inherit these limitations.\nTo model vehicle inflows, we leverage Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) Huntsinger (2022), which is the most reliable openly available arterial traffic flow data for all three cities. These datasets are published by the Department of Transportation of each state/city. The quality of AADT data varies across states. In the state of California, only a limited number of streets have recorded data, necessitating reliable estimation methods. For them, we formulate a flow decomposition problem isnpired by popular"}]}

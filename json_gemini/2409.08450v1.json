INTRODUCTION", "content": "Multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) is one of the most crucial parts of modern decision science, which includes the process of determining the best optimal solution from all multiple decision attributes and alternatives [1], [2] with respect to the group of experts. The key role is to support the decision analysts to take all necessary objectives and subjective attributes of the problem into contemplation to employ rational and explicit decision procedure [2], [3]. MAGDM has been extensively applied to various fields such as medicine, management, pattern analysis domain, and classification [2], [4]\u2013[7], which has acquired more attention from researchers [1], [2], [8]. In pattern classification, the MAGDM is generally used in feature fusion to acquire a desirable recognition interpretation based on the fused features. The MAGDM problems exhibit three key characteristics: alternatives, multiple attributes with incomparable units, and multiple experts, in which the expert's weights holds a significant part. Determining the weight of experts is an essential research area. Several techniques have been introduced for determining the weights of the experts [9], [10].\nThe traditional group decision-making approaches commonly focus on calculating results through the majority and voting principles, which is a straightforward arithmetic aggregation procedure ignoring trade-offs among alternatives and experts. Due to that, group decision-making (GDM) approaches [11], [12] have been proposed to overcome the inconsistency and compute the optimal agreed results. In this regard, some approaches [9], [13]\u2013[15] used the relative importance or preference relations between the group of experts by determining the influence relations. The weight determination methods that are focused on pairwise comparisons include two classes of approaches [16] that can be utilized to intervene in the discrepancy between the experts. In the first approach, the individual decisions are aggregated, in which initially, the pairwise comparison of different experts is incorporated into one, and the resultant aggregation pairwise comparison is treated as a single expert problem [16], [17]. However, in the other class, the individuals' preference is aggregated, in which a weight vector is generated for each expert [4], [18], [19]. The generated set of weight vectors is transformed into a single weight vector by employing Dempster Shafer's theory or utilizing various types of aggregation operators to determine the optimal weights. Although these approaches are simple to implement, but the information loss is extensive, and while computing the weights for experts, the inter-observational variability among the alternatives is not taken into consideration. These aforementioned challenges motivate us to propose a MAGDM approach that considers the degree of belief for each alternative which includes the inter-observational variability between the group of experts.\nWith this view, this study aims to develop a MAGDM framework based on the Evidential ordered weighted belief divergence measure to evaluate the support for each expert and transform it into a consensus situation. For computing the ordered weighted belief divergence measure, the construction of ordered weighted belief and plausibility is proposed. The basic probability assignment (BPA) generation method has been introduced to evaluate the ordered weighted belief and plausibility measure, which analyzes the crucial information by considering the alternative responses corresponding to the attributes. It helps to assess the belongingness of each alternative corresponding to the domain of the attribute that is partitioned by selecting the suitable number of linguistic term sets followed by computing BPAs. The empirical study of the proposed Evidential MAGDM technique is demonstrated over an illustrative example to show the efficacy of the proposed approach. We have shown the effectiveness of the proposed technique in real-world problems to assess the capability of handling uncertainty and inter-observational behavior in the feature fusion module for the diagnosis of retinal disorders. In our study, we propose an ensemble classifier feature fusion using the proposed Evidential MAGDM approach for the classification of various retinal disorders by integrating the multi-expert view phenomena. The proposed system includes three expert paths to generate the OCT dataset at a different scale space followed by integrating the EfficientNet-BO model [20]. The model extracts the discriminative feature representation at various scales to capture the diversity in feature representation locally and globally, which influences the classification probability for the diagnosis of retinal disease through OCT images. The extracted features from each path are fused together using the proposed Evidential MAGDM approach by handling the conflict and impreciseness emerging between the distinctive features at various scales, followed by the classification of retinal disorders. In a nutshell, the contribution to this is recapitulated as follows:\n\u2022 This study proposes a generation framework of BPAS for MAGDM with respect to the group of experts by computing the belief degree based on partitioning the domain of attribute into linguistic terms.\n\u2022 We propose an ordered weighted belief measure to compute the overall belongingness by considering inter-observational variability evidence of each alternative corresponding to the attributes and to analyze the conflicts and discrepancy between the group of experts; the ordered weighted plausibility measure is proposed.\n\u2022 We propose an ordered weighted belief generalized divergence measure to compute the weighted support for each expert for MAGDM.\n\u2022 We propose an Evidential MAGDM framework based on the constructed ordered weighted belief divergence measure to compute overall weights for each group of experts.\n\u2022 To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed Evidential MAGDM approach, an illustrative example is demonstrated.\n\u2022 We propose the application of the Evidential MAGDM method in the ensemble classifier feature fusion for the diagnosis of retinal disorders.\nThe remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows: Section II briefly introduces the key concepts of BPA and divergence measures. Section III introduces the Evidential MAGDM approach. In Section IV, a numerical example and comparative analysis are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, followed by an application to the ensemble classifier feature fusion for diagnosing the retinal disorder. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section V."}, {"title": "II. PREREQUISITES", "content": "A. Theory of Belief Functions\nVarious approaches have been exploited to address the uncertainty in recent times. DS evidence theory of the belief function is one of the tools that provides a general technique for modeling uncertainty and is widely executed in various areas. This section proceeds towards presenting the basic concepts that are considered helpful in the subsequent work.\nDefinition 1. Frame of Discernment [21]: Let \u03a9 be a set of n mutually exclusive elements, which can be expressed as \u03a9 = {\u03c9\u2081, ..., \u03c9\u2099}. Then, the set \u03a9 is called a frame of discernment. The power set of \u03a9 is defined as 2\u1dbf = {\u00d8, {\u03c9\u2081}, {\u03c9\u2081, \u03c9\u2082}, ..., \u03a9}. If U \u2208 2\u1dbf, U is called proposition.\nDefinition 2. Basic Probability Assignment [21], [22]: It is a mapping m : 2\u1dbf \u2192 [0, 1], which satisfies:\n$m(\u00d8) = 0, \\sum_{U \\subseteq \\Omega} m(U) = 1$   (1)\nIf m(U) > 0, then U is said to be a focal element. The value m(U) signifies the belief degree to support proposition U. In DS evidence theory, m is also called a basic belief assignment (BBA).\nIn DS evidence theory, the belief and plausibility function is related to BPA, which represents the lower and upper bounds for each proposition in a BPA, and it can be described as follows:\nDefinition 3. Belief Function [22]: It is a mapping Bel : 2\u1dbf \u2192 [0, 1] and it can be defined as:\n$Bel(U) = \\sum_{A \\subseteq U} m(A)$  (2)\nDefinition 4. Plausibility Function [22]: It is a mapping Pl : 2\u1dbf \u2192 [0, 1], and it can be defined as:\n$Pl(U) = \\sum_{A \\cap U \\neq \\emptyset} m(U), Pl(U) = 1 \u2013 Bel(U)$ (3)\nIt is to be noted that Pl(U) \u2265 Bel(U) for each U \u2286 \u03a9.\nDefinition 5. Dempster's Combination Rule [21]: Let two BPAs m\u2081 and m\u2082 that are independent in frame of discernment \u03a9, Dempster's rule of combination m\u2081 \u2295 m\u2082, is defined as follows:\n$(m_1 \\oplus m_2) A = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{1-K} \\sum_{A_1 \\cap A_2 = A} m_1(A_1) m_2(A_2), A \\neq \\emptyset \\\\ 0, A = \\emptyset \\end{cases}$ (4)\nwith $K = \\sum_{A_1 \\cap A_2 = \\emptyset} m_1(A_1) m_2(A_2)$, where K denotes the coefficient of conflicts between BPAs m\u2081 and m\u2082.\nB. Generalized Jensen Shannon Divergence Measures\nIn information theory, divergence measures are employed to measure the discrepancy of data information and are widely exploited in various application areas [19], [23]. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence [24] is one of the popular divergence measures which is non-negative, additive, but not symmetric. In this regard, a new divergence measure called the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure [25] is introduced such that it is symmetric but also satisfies the boundedness and the range between 0 to 1 for the logarithmic base 2, which is illustrated below.\nDefinition 6. [25] The Jensen-Shannon divergence between two probability distributions A = {a\u2081, a\u2082, ..., a\u2099} and B = {b\u2081, b\u2082, ..., b\u2099} is defined as follows:\n$JS(A, B) = \\frac{1}{2} [I(A, \\frac{A+B}{2}) + I(B, \\frac{A+B}{2})]$ (5)\nwhere I(A, B) is the KL divergence [24].\nDefinition 7. Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence [25]: Let A\u2081, A\u2082, ..., A\u209a be p probability distributions with weights w\u2081, w\u2082, ..., w\u209a, respectively. The generalized Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence can be expressed as\n$JSw(A_1, A_2, ..., A_p) = H(\\sum_{i=1}^p w_i A_i) - \\sum_{i=1}^p w_i H(A_i)$ (6)\nwhere $H(A_i) = - \\sum_{a_{ij}} a_{ij} log a_{ij}$ with $\\sum a_{ij} = 1$ (i = 1, 2, ..., n; j = 1, 2, ..., p).\nBelief Jensen-Shannon (BJS) divergence measure was proposed in [26] to measure the conflicts between two BPAs by considering the belief and plausibility measure and it can be defined as:\nDefinition 8. [26] The divergence measure between two independent BPAs m\u2081 and m\u2082 define on \u03a9 is defined as:\n$Div(m_1, m_2) = \\frac{1}{2} [I(WPBl_{m1}, \\frac{WPBl_{m1} + WPBl_{m2}}{2}) + I(WPBl_{m2}, \\frac{WPBl_{m1} + WPBl_{m2}}{2})]$ (7)\nwhere, $WPBl_m(A_i) = \\frac{Bel(A_i) + Pl(A_i)}{\\sum_{A_i} Bel(A_i) + Pl(A_i)}$.\nThe Div(m\u2081, m\u2082) can also be expressed in the following form:\n$\\frac{1}{2} [\\sum_{A \\subseteq \\Omega} WPBl_{m_1}(A_i) log \\frac{2WPBl_{m_1}(A_i)}{WPBl_{m_1}(A_i) + WPBl_{m_2}(A_i)} + \\sum_{A \\subseteq \\Omega} WPBl_{m_2}(A_i) log \\frac{2WPBl_{m_2}(A_i)}{WPBl_{m_1}(A_i) + WPBl_{m_2}(A_i)} ]$ (8)\nNext, we propose a BPA generation method to evaluate the degree of support for each alternative with respect to the attributes for group decision-making, followed by the construction of ordered weighted belief and plausibility function. To calculate the weighted support for each expert for the fusion, a novel construction method for a generalized weighted belief divergence measure is proposed, which will consider the inter-observational variability between the alternatives and handle the conflicts occurring between the group of experts."}, {"title": "III. THE PROPOSED EVIDENTIAL MAGDM METHODOLOGY", "content": "This section introduces a BPA generation method for each alternative corresponding to the attribute associated with experts using the membership function for the linguistic value, followed by the construction of ordered weighted belief and plausibility function. To handle the conflicts occurring between the group of experts and impreciseness, a generalized ordered weighted belief divergence measure is proposed.\nA. BPAs generation for a group decision making\nIn this study, we assume that {A\u2081, A\u2082, ..., A\u209a} (p \u2265 2, P = {1, 2, ..., p}) be a discrete set of feasible alternatives, {t\u2081, t\u2082, ..., tq} (Q = {1, 2, ..., q}) be a set of attributes; {u\u2081, u\u2082, ..., uk} (K = {1, 2, ..., k}) be the group of experts. A multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) can be represented as follows:\n$Y_k = \\begin{pmatrix} t_1 & t_2 & ... & t_q \\\\ A_1 & y_{11}^{(k)} & y_{12}^{(k)} & ... & y_{1q}^{(k)} \\\\ A_2 & y_{21}^{(k)} & y_{22}^{(k)} & ... & y_{2q}^{(k)} \\\\ : & : & : & & : \\\\ A_p & y_{p1}^{(k)} & y_{p2}^{(k)} & ... & y_{pq}^{(k)} \\end{pmatrix}_{pxq}, k \\in K$ (9)\nbe the decision matrix provided by kth expert. In order to evaluate all attributes in dimensionless units and facilitate inter-attribute comparisons, each attribute of the considered decision matrix is normalized [27] using Eqs. 10 and obtain corresponding element $y_{ij}^{(k)}$ in normalized decision matrix Yk.\n$Y_{ij}^{(k)} = \\frac{y_{ij}^{(k)}}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{P}(y_{ij}^{(k)})^2}}, (i \\in P, j \\in Q, k \\in K)$, (10)\nfor benefit attribute tj.\nAs considered above, there are k experts; each expert provides their preference over the alternatives corresponding to attributes. These provided subjective/objective preferences for the alternative may differ according to the group of experts, which influences the final decision-making framework. The primary goal is to compute the weighted support for the above-considered MAGDM problem by considering this fact.\nDue to subjectiviy in experts' opinions, it is assumed that there is still uncertainty in their expressions. Opinions are not fully precise. In a broader sense, it may be said that there is a chance of variation of a particular opinion for some external causes. Causes may be - expert's attitude, peer's influence, incomplete knowledge, the complexity of studied systems, or any other environmental factors. In order to capture these chance factors, we present the framework to compute the degree of belief in terms of basic probability assignment (BPA). Another challenge is to capture the diversity emerging among the group of experts without hindering the degree of belief (support) associated with the alternatives. Consequently, we propose a weighted belief divergence measure to assess the diversity emerging between the group of experts for each alternative. It is computed based on the ordered weighted belief and plausibility measure, which handles the conflicts occurring between the group of experts and comprises the degree of belief for each alternative. The ordered weighted divergence measure relies on belief and plausibility measures, which capture the degree of confidence by evaluating the support of belongingness in the domain of the attributes, followed by examining the provided subjective/objective preference relationship among the experts for each alternative to handle the conflicting information. The subjective preference of the alternative is stretched over the domain of attribute for the evaluation of the ordered weighted belief and plausibility measure, which analyzes the inter-observational variability between the group of experts. For computing belief and plausibility measures, we need to evaluate basic probability assignment, which defines the degree of confidence. For computing the degree of belief for each alternative over the attribute domain, we have scaled the subjective preferences of alternatives over the attribute domain by employing the idea presented in [28]. We have utilized the augmented number of linguistic terms for partitioning the domain of the attribute to capture the intrinsic characteristic and inter-observational variability among the alternatives for each linguistic term set, as shown in Fig. 1. In this work, it is assumed that\n$\\mu_{B^{H+1}}(Y) = \\mu_{high_H}(Y) = \\begin{cases} 1-\\frac{(d - y)}{(d - c)} & if c \\leq y \\leq d \\\\ 0 & otherwise, \\end{cases}$ (13)\nIn this work, we have determined a $l$ linguistic term set associated with triangular membership functions {\u03bc\u03b2\u2081, \u03bc\u03b2\u2082,\u2026\u2026, \u03bc\u03b2\u2097 } to characterize the alternative's belongingness with respect to the attributes.\n$R_k = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu_{t_1 B_1}^{kA_1} & \\mu_{t_2 B_1}^{kA_1} & ... & \\mu_{t_q B_1}^{kA_1} \\\\ \\mu_{t_1 B_1}^{kA_2} & \\mu_{t_2 B_1}^{kA_2} & ... & \\mu_{t_q B_1}^{kA_2} \\\\ : & : & & : \\\\ \\mu_{t_1 B_1}^{kA_p} & \\mu_{t_2 B_1}^{kA_p} & ... & \\mu_{t_q B_1}^{kA_p} \\end{pmatrix}$, (14)\nwhere $c = min_{1 \\leq i \\leq p} \\{ y_{ij}^{(k)} \\}, d = max_{1 \\leq i \\leq p} \\{ y_{ij}^{(k)} \\} (k \\in K)$ with respect to the attribute tj, and $B_l (i \\in P, j \\in Q, k \\in K)$ represents the degree of belongingness in the partitioned domain $B_l$ for the attribute tj corresponding to the kth expert. To obtain the basic probability assignments (BPAs) for each alternative corresponding to the attributes, the above matrix is normalized column-wise as follows to satisfy the criterion for the BPAs given in Eq. 1.\n$\\overline{R_k} = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{t_1 B_1}^{kA_1} & m_{t_2 B_1}^{kA_1} & ... & m_{t_q B_1}^{kA_1} \\\\ m_{t_1 B_1}^{kA_2} & m_{t_2 B_1}^{kA_2} & ... & m_{t_q B_1}^{kA_2} \\\\ : & : & & : \\\\ m_{t_1 B_1}^{kA_p} & m_{t_2 B_1}^{kA_p} & ... & m_{t_q B_1}^{kA_p} \\end{pmatrix}$, (15)\nwhere $m_{t_j B_l}^{kA_i} = \\frac{\\mu_{t_j B_l}^{kA_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^P \\mu_{t_j B_l}^{kA_i}} (i \\in P, j \\in Q, k \\in K)$.\nThe decision matrix $\\overline{R_k}$ in Eq. 15 represents the BPAs of each alternative with respect to the attributes corresponding to the kth expert, which indicates the degree of support (belief) with respect to each partitioned region to handles the impreciseness between the alternative data information. Next, we construct the ordered weighted belief and plausibility function to evaluate the overall support for each alternative by assessing the conflicts occurring in the decisions.\nB. Construction of Ordered Weighted Belief, Plausibility, and Ordered Weighted Belief Divergence Measure based on experts\nThis section introduces the ordered weighted belief function and plausibility function, followed by a generalized ordered weighted divergence measure based on the belief and plausibility function.\nDefinition 9. The ordered weighted belief function based on the weighting vector w = (w\u2081, w\u2082, ..., w\u2097), with $\\sum_{f=1}^l w_f = 1$, wf \u2208 [0, 1], for alternative A\u1d62, with respect to the attribute tj is defined as:\n$Bel_{tj}^k(A_i) = \\sum_{f=1}^l w_f m_{t_j B_{\\sigma(f)}}^{kA_i}, i \\in P, j \\in Q$ (16)\nwhere \u03c3: {1,2,...,1} \u2192 {1, 2, ..., 1} is a permutation such that $m_{t_j B_{\\sigma(1)}}^{kA_i} \\geq m_{t_j B_{\\sigma(2)}}^{kA_i} \\geq ... \\geq m_{t_j B_{\\sigma(1)}}^{kA_i}$.\nHere, $Bel_{tj}^k(A_i)$ represents a total amount of belief supporting necessarily to the alternative A\u1d62 corresponding to the attribute tj with respect to the kth expert by giving the higher weight to the most supported belief degree using the orness concept for weight determination [29]. The more dispersed the wf, the more individual belief degree is used to evaluate the overall support for alternative A\u1d62 with respect to the kth expert.\nDefinition 10. The plausibility function for alternative A\u1d62 based on the expert uk corresponding to the attribute tj is defined as\n$Pl_{tj}^k(A_i) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k Bel_{tj}^k(A_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^k Bel_{tj}^k(A_i)}$ (17)\nWhere $Pl_{tj}^k(A_i)$ quantifies the overall amount of belief for alternative A\u1d62 with respect to the group of experts by enduring the conflicts and impreciseness emerging between the experts. Next, we define an ordered weighted belief divergence measure based on the ordered weighted belief and plausibility function to measure discrepancy and conflict among the group of experts by considering the inter-observational variability between the group of experts for the alternatives.\nDefinition 11. Given two independent BPAs m\u2081 and m\u2082, define on the frame of discriminant \u03a9, the weighted divergence between m\u2081 and m\u2082 based on set of weights w\u2081, w\u2082 \u2265 0 with w\u2081 + w\u2082 = 1 is defined as:\n$Div_w (m_1, m_2) = \\sum_{i=1}^2 w_i \\sum_{A \\subseteq \\Omega} WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(i)}}(A_j) log \\frac{WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(i)}}(A_j)}{w_1 WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(1)}}(A_j) + w_2 WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(2)}}(A_j)}$ (18)\nwhere, $WPBl = \\frac{Bel + Pl}{2}$ (i \u2208 {1,2}) and $WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(1)}}(A_j) \\geq WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(2)}}(A_j)$, then the Eq. 18 can be expressed in Eq. 7. The Eq. 18 can be expressed as the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measure, which depends on the weights [25]. One of the key features of the weighted JS divergence is that we can allocate distinct weights to the distributions implicated according to their prominence. Therefore, the weights associated in Eq. 18 restrain the trade-off behavior arising between the data information with respect to the group of experts in the evaluation of the divergence measure. To consider the discrepancy between groups of experts, the generalized weighted belief divergence based on Jensen Shannon inspired from [30] in terms of belief and plausibility for multiple BPAS is defined as follows:\nDefinition 12. Given the set of BPAs {m\u2081, m\u2082, ..., m\u209a} over the frame of discriminant \u03a9 with corresponding set of weights {w\u2081, ..., w\u209a} with $\\sum_{i=1}^p w_i = 1$, the generalized weighted divergence is defined as:\n$GDiv_w (m_1, m_2, ..., m_p) = \\sum_{i=1}^p w_i \\sum_{A \\subseteq \\Omega} WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(i)}}(A_j) log \\frac{WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(i)}}(A_j)}{w_1 WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(1)}}(A_j) + ... + w_p WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(p)}}(A_j)}$ (19)\nwhere, $WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(1)}}(A_j) \\geq ... \\geq WPBl_{m_{\\sigma(p)}}(A_j)$ for any permutation \u03c3 : {1, ..., p} \u2192 {1, ..., p}. When p = 2 and |A|= 1, then the Eq. 19 is reduced in the Eq. 18. Next, we present the properties of the proposed generalized divergence measure.\nProperty III.1. GDivw(m\u2081, ..., mi, ..., mp) is bounded, where 0 \u2264 GDivw(m\u2081, ..., mi, ..., mp) \u2264 log p.\nProperty III.2. GDivw(m\u2081, ..., mi, ..., mp) = 0 if and only if mi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p) are equal.\nProperty III.3. The proposed divergence measure is symmetrical, GDivw(m\u2081,..., mp) = GDivw (m\u03c3(1), ..., m\u03c3(p)) for any permutation \u03c3: {1, ..., p} \u2192 {1, ..., p}.\nNext, we presented the framework of the Evidential MAGDM technique by computing the belief degree for each alternative for determining the expert weight to obtain the agreed results by considering all the necessary aspects of the group of experts.\nC. Proposed framework for group decision making\nThis section introduces the proposed framework for group decision-making demonstrated in Fig. 2 by conceptualizing the novel ordered weighted belief and plausibility functions followed by the ordered weighted belief divergence measure for computing the expert's weight by considering inter-observational variability and controlling the impact of conflicting information, which will not affect the final decision. The proposed framework for MAGDM for evaluating an expert's weight can be elaborated in the following steps:\nStep 1.

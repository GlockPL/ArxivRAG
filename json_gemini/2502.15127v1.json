While recent advances have produced AI systems that can engage with students and\ncurate educational content [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], these systems often lack deep understanding of student cognition - how\nstudents develop misconceptions, how they reason incorrectly, and why they make specific mistakes [11, 12, 3, 13].\nThis understanding is critical for providing meaningful educational support, whether through tutoring, feedback, or\nassessment. Currently, it's difficult to determine whether an AI system possesses this crucial understanding of student\nthinking [14, 15, 16].\nTraditional evaluation methods like measuring learning gains, while important, suffer from significant limitations. These\nstudies not only require months or even years to conduct [17, 18, 19], but their results are confounded by numerous\nvariables - including changes in student motivation and external support, variations in classroom environments and\nteaching styles, and broader educational policy shifts that occur during the study period [20, 21]. Such confounders\nmake it difficult to isolate whether any observed improvements truly stem from the AI system's deep understanding of\nstudent cognition or from other factors entirely.\nIn contrast to traditional studies with their many confounding variables, we propose a two-phase evaluation methodology\nto directly test an AI system's understanding of student cognition. In Phase 1, students complete open-ended questions\nwithout multiple choice options, providing unbiased samples of natural misconceptions. In Phase 2, for each incorrect\nanswer from Phase 1, the AI must generate a new but related question Q' and predict what wrong answer A' the same\nstudent would give to Q'. The key innovation is that these predictions are explicitly conditioned on each student's specific\nPhase 1 mistakes - without this conditioning, any approach would simply target the most common misconceptions\nrather than demonstrate understanding of individual reasoning. This creates a personalized test of the AI's ability to\nmodel individual student thinking. The student then receives Q' as a multiple choice question containing the correct\nanswer, the AI's predicted wrong answer A', a human expert's predicted wrong answer A\u201d, and a random incorrect\nanswer. By analyzing whether students select AI-generated distractors at rates similar to human expert-generated ones,\nwe can directly validate if the AI system genuinely models student cognition.\nThis approach mirrors the Turing test in a compelling way: just as the original test evaluates AI through its ability to\nproduce human-like conversational responses, our framework evaluates AI through its ability to predict student mistakes\nas accurately as expert teachers do. Success requires two fundamental capabilities: understanding common patterns in\nstudent misconceptions and predicting how these misconceptions will manifest for individual students across different\nproblems. An AI system that can match human experts in this prediction task demonstrates genuine understanding of\nstudent cognition - it's not just recognizing statistical patterns, but modeling the underlying reasoning processes that\nlead students to specific mistakes.\nThis understanding of student cognition, as demonstrated through distractor generation conditioned on a student's\nspecific errors, is not just a narrow capability but underpins virtually every aspect of AI-supported education. An AI\nsystem that can model how a student reasons about a concept, based on observing their specific mistakes, can better\nadapt its tutoring, feedback, and assessments to that student's needs. Our research thus positions conditioned distractor\ngeneration not merely as an evaluation tool, but as a probe into an AI system's fundamental ability to model student\nthinking - a capability essential for meaningful educational support. While predicting wrong answers might seem a\nnarrow technical challenge, we show it requires precisely the kind of deep understanding of student cognition that has\nbeen missing from current educational AI systems. This paper makes several key contributions:\n1. A Novel Turing-like Test for Educational AI: We introduce a practical and efficient approach to evaluating\neducational AI systems through a two-phase Turing-like test. Unlike traditional evaluation methods that require\nlengthy studies of learning outcomes, our test provides a direct measure of an AI system's ability to model\nstudent thinking by having it generate new questions and predict errors based on observed student mistakes.\nThe test evaluates whether these AI-generated predictions are indistinguishable from those created by expert\nhuman educators, providing a concrete benchmark for measuring progress in educational AI systems' ability\nto understand individual student reasoning.\n2. Positioning Conditioned Distractor Generation as a Core Test of Educational AI Capabilities: Building\non this testing methodology, we establish that the ability to generate distractors conditioned on a student's\nspecific errors provides a fundamental test of an educational AI system's capabilities. Through our two-phase\nmethodology - first observing natural student mistakes and then generating new questions with predicted errors\nwe show that success at this task requires deep modeling of individual student thinking. This provides both a\ntheoretical framework for understanding what capabilities educational AI systems need and a practical method\nfor evaluating these capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates that these same cognitive modeling abilities\nunderpin various educational applications, from providing targeted feedback to designing adaptive assessments\nmaking this test a powerful proxy for evaluating educational AI systems."}, {"title": "Test Design", "content": "Our proposed evaluation framework consists of two distinct phases designed to validate an AI system's understanding of\nstudent misconceptions. In the first phase, we collect unbiased samples of student misconceptions through open-ended\nresponses. The second phase tests whether the AI system can accurately predict how these misconceptions will manifest\nin a newly generated question.\nLet S denote our set of students and D our domain of questions. For any student $s \\in S$ and question $q \\in D$, we define\n$A(s, q)$ as the student's response and $C(q)$ as the correct answer.\nIn Phase 1, each student s responds to a set of questions $Q_s \\subset D$ without multiple choice options. For each incorrect\nresponse, we record the tuple $(s, q, A(s, q))$ where $A(s, q) \\neq C(q)$. These tuples provide unbiased samples of natural\nstudent misconceptions, uninfluenced by the presence of pre-selected answer choices.\nFor Phase 2, given each Phase 1 tuple $(s, q, A(s, q))$:\n1. The AI system implements a function $f_{LLM} : D \\times A \\rightarrow D$ that generates a new question q' based on the original\nquestion and incorrect answer.\n2. Given q', both our AI system and a human expert independently generate predicted wrong answers. The AI\nsystem implements $G_{AI} : D \\times D \\times A \\rightarrow A$ that generates prediction a', while the human expert implements\n$g_H : D \\times D \\times A \\rightarrow A$ generating prediction a\". A random wrong answer r is also generated to serve as a control.\n3. The student s then receives question q' as a multiple choice question with four options presented in random order:\nthe correct answer C(q'), the AI-predicted wrong answer a', the expert-predicted wrong answer a\", and the random\nanswer r. The student's selection is denoted $P2(s, q, q').$"}, {"title": "Statistical Sampling Theory for Personalized Misconception Tracking", "content": "We develop a statistical framework to determine how many students and questions are needed to validate that an AI\nsystem can effectively track and predict individual student misconceptions. We show that despite the vast space of\npossible misconceptions, we can achieve high-confidence validation with surprisingly few students and questions."}, {"title": "Validating AI Prediction of Student Misconceptions", "content": "To meaningfully compare AI and human expert ability to predict student misconceptions, we need precise statistical\ncriteria. Specifically, when a student makes a particular mistake on one question, we want to test whether an AI system\ncan predict their likely mistakes on related questions as accurately as human experts can. This means we need to prove\ntwo things: first, that students choose the AI's predicted wrong answers at rates similar to human-expert predicted\nwrong answers, and second, that both AI and human predictions significantly outperform random guessing. In this\nsection, we establish the formal statistical framework for making these comparisons and determine the sample sizes\nneeded for rigorous validation.\nDefinition 2. For any Phase 1 tuple (S, Q, A) where student S made mistake A on question Q, and corresponding\nPhase 2 question Q', we define:\nAI\nif student selects AI-predicted answer A'\nChoice(S, Q') =\nHuman if student selects expert-predicted answer A\"\nRandom if student selects random wrong answer R\nCorrect if student selects correct answer C\nThe prediction quality for each source (AI or Human) is the probability their predicted wrong answer matches the\nstudent's actual mistake:\n$P_{AI} = P(Choice(S, Q') = AI | (S, Q, A))$ (1)\n$P_{Human} = P(Choice(S, Q') = Human | (S, Q, A))$ (2)\nTheorem 4. An Al system's prediction quality matches human expert quality if, with confidence level 1 - \u03b1:\n1. The difference in prediction rates is small:\n$P_{AI} - P_{Human} \\leq \\epsilon$ (3)\n2. Both significantly outperform random guessing:\n$P_{AI} > P_{Random} + \\delta$ (4)\n$P_{Human} > P_{Random} + \\delta$ (5)\nwhere:\n$\\bullet \\epsilon$ is the maximum acceptable difference between AI and human performance\n$\\bullet \\delta$ is the minimum required improvement over random guessing\n$\\bullet P_{Random} = \\frac{1}{4}$ is the probability of random selection from 4 choices\nProof. Let n be the total number of Phase 2 responses.

Bernoulli random variables with finite variance:"}, {"title": "Validating AI Prediction of Student Misconceptions", "content": "$\\sqrt{n} (\\overline{X}_{AI} - P_{AI}) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, P_{AI}(1 - P_{AI}))$ (8)\n$\\sqrt{n} (\\overline{X}_{Human} - P_{Human}) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, P_{Human}(1 - P_{Human}))$ (9)\nFor the difference statistic, since responses are paired:\n$\\sqrt{n} (\\overline{X}_{AI} - \\overline{X}_{Human} - (P_{AI} - P_{Human})) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^2)$ (10)\nwhere $\\sigma^2 = P_{AI}(1 - P_{AI}) + P_{Human}(1 - P_{Human}) - 2\\rho\\sqrt{P_{AI}P_{Human}(1 - P_{AI})(1 - P_{Human})}$ and $\\rho$ is the correlation\ncoefficient.\nSample Size Calculation For condition (3), using McNemar's test:\n$Z_1 = \\frac{\\overline{X}_{AI} - \\overline{X}_{Human}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2/n}} \\sim N(0, 1)$ (11)\nFor equivalence testing with margin $\\epsilon$:\n$n_1 = \\frac{z_{(\\alpha/2)}^2 \\sigma^2}{\\epsilon^2}$ (12)\nFor conditions (4) and (5), using one-sided tests:\n$n_2 = \\frac{(z_\\alpha)^2 P_{Random} (1 - P_{Random})}{\\delta^2}$ (13)\nThe required sample size is therefore:\n$n \\geq max\\{n_1, n_2\\}$ (14)\nRelationship to Earlier Sampling Framework From Theorem 2, we need $N = O(\\frac{k log(1/\\delta)}{p_{min}})$ students. From\nTheorem 3, we need $Q = O(\\frac{k ln(k)}{t})$ questions per student. The total Phase 2 responses n must satisfy:\nn\u2264N\u22c5Q=O(k2ln(k)ln(1/\u03b4)tpmin) (15)\nFor typical values (k = 10, t = 2, pmin = 0.05, \u03b4 = 0.05), this yields n \u2248 400, which satisfies our calculated sample\nsize requirements when  = 0.1 and \u03b1 = 0.05.\nRemark. The sample size calculation assumes responses are independent. In practice, there may be correlation between\nresponses from the same student, suggesting use of mixed-effects models for more precise analysis.\nDefinition 3 (Victory Conditions). Given Phase 2 response data, we say:\n1. Al wins if $P_{AI} > P_{Human} + \\epsilon$ with confidence 1 \u2212 \u03b1\n2. Human wins if $P_{Human} > P_{AI} + \\epsilon$ with confidence 1 \u2212 \u03b1\n3. Draw occurs if $|P_{AI} - P_{Human}| \\leq \\epsilon$ with confidence 1 \u2212 \u03b1\nwhere both $P_{AI}$ and $P_{Human}$ must exceed $P_{Random} + \\delta$ for the result to be valid.\nCorollary 1 (Statistical Test for Victory). Let $Z_{diff} = \\frac{\\overline{X}_{AI} - \\overline{X}_{Human}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2/n}}$.\nThen:\n$\\bullet$ If $Z_{diff} > z_{1-\\alpha}$: Al wins\n$\\bullet$ If $Z_{diff} < -z_{1-\\alpha}$: Human wins\n$\\bullet$ Otherwise: Draw"}, {"title": "Validating AI Prediction of Student Misconceptions", "content": "where $z_{1-\\alpha}$ is the (1 \u2212 \u03b1) quantile of the standard normal distribution.\nProof of Victory Conditions Corollary. Under the null hypothesis of equal prediction quality ($P_{AI} = P_{Human}$), and\ngiven the asymptotic normality shown earlier:\n$Z_{diff} = \\frac{\\overline{X}_{AI} - \\overline{X}_{Human}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2/n}} \\sim N(0, 1)$\nFor AI victory, we require:\n$P(P_{AI} > P_{Human} + \\epsilon) \\geq 1 - \\alpha$\n$\\implies P(Z_{diff} > \\frac{\\epsilon \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}) \\geq 1 - \\alpha$\n$\\implies Z_{diff} > z_{1-\\alpha}$\nSimilarly for human victory:\n$P(P_{Human} > P_{AI} + \\epsilon) \\geq 1 - \\alpha$\n$\\implies P(Z_{diff} < -\\frac{\\epsilon \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}) \\geq 1 - \\alpha$\n$\\implies Z_{diff} < -z_{1-\\alpha}$\nIf neither condition holds, we have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of equal performance, resulting in\na draw.\nCritically, this test is only valid when both systems outperform random guessing:\n$min(P_{AI}, P_{Human}) > P_{Random} + \\delta$ (16)\nThis ensures we're comparing meaningful prediction strategies rather than random noise.\nTheorem 5 (Feedback Capability). An Al system that passes our two-phase test can both identify and generate targeted\npractice problems for at least a (1 \u2212 ) fraction of student misconceptions with probability at least (1 \u2212 2\u0431).\nProof. The proof leverages the two-phase design:\n1. By Phase 1, we observe student misconceptions through open-ended responses\n2. By Phase 2 success, we prove the AI can:\n$\\bullet$ Identify the underlying misconception from (S,Q,A)\n$\\bullet$ Generate new question Q' testing the same concept\n$\\bullet$ Predict student response A' to Q'\n3. By the Misconception Concentration theorem, this capability covers (1 \u2013 ) of student misconceptions\n4. The ability to generate targeted Q' demonstrates feedback capability through practice problem generation\nTherefore, with probability at least (1 \u2013 2\u0431), the system can provide targeted practice through new question generation\nfor at least a (1 \u2013 ) fraction of student misconceptions."}, {"title": "The Insufficiency of Unconditioned Single-Phase Testing", "content": "A natural starting point for evaluating an AI system's understanding of student cognition would be to test its ability to\ngenerate plausible wrong answers that students might choose. The intuition is compelling: if an AI can anticipate how\nstudents will err, surely it understands how they think. This leads to a simple unconditioned single-phase test where\nboth AI and human experts generate distractors for multiple choice questions without knowledge of individual student\nreasoning patterns. Let us formalize this design:\nDefinition 4 (Unconditioned Single-Phase Test Design). For any question q, let:\n$\\bullet$ C(q) be the correct answer\n$\\bullet$ A(q) be the AI-generated distractor\n$\\bullet$ H(q) be the human expert-generated distractor\n$\\bullet$ R(q) be a randomly generated incorrect answer\nThe test presents these options in random order to students. Let S(q, s) represent student s's selection for question q.\nCritically, both A(q) and H(q) are generated without observing any prior responses from student s.\nDefinition 5 (Performance Metrics). The quality of AI-generated distractors would be evaluated by comparing selection\nrates:\n$P_A = P(S(q, s) = A(q))$\n$P_H = P(S(q, s) = H(q))$\nwith the AI system \"passing\" if $|P_A - P_H | < \\epsilon$ for some small  > 0.\nHowever, this unconditioned approach has fundamental flaws that make it inadequate for validating true understanding\nof student cognition:\nTheorem 6 (Unconditioned Convergence). Given a question q with misconception set M(q) = {m1, ..., mk} where\nP(mi) represents the probability of misconception mi in the student population, both AI and human experts will\nrationally converge to targeting m* = arg maxmi\u2208M(q) P(mi).\nProof. For any distractor generator (AI or human), the expected selection rate is maximized by targeting the most\ncommon misconception:\nE[p] =\u2211ki=1P(mi)I(mi targeted) \u2264 maxi P(mi)\nwith equality achieved only when targeting m*.\nThis convergence creates two critical problems:\n1. Population-Level Optimization: Both AI and human experts are incentivized to target the single most\ncommon misconception for each question, regardless of individual student reasoning patterns. This reduces\nthe test to measuring statistical pattern matching rather than understanding of student cognition.\n2. False Equivalence: An AI system could \"pass\" this test by simply learning population-level statistics about\ncommon wrong answers, without any actual understanding of how individual students reason about concepts\nor how their misconceptions evolve across related problems.\nThese flaws demonstrate why a conditioned two-phase design is necessary - one that can validate an AI system's ability\nto model individual student reasoning rather than just aggregate statistics. To overcome the limitations of unconditioned\ntesting, our two-phase design introduces crucial conditioning on individual student reasoning. In Phase 1, each student\ns provides open-ended responses to questions Qs, generating tuples (s, q, A(s, q)) where A(s, q) is their incorrect\nanswer. In Phase 2, given each Phase 1 tuple (s, q, A(s, q)), both the AI system and human experts observe this specific\nstudent mistake and use it to inform their predictions. The AI generates a new question q' and predicts the wrong\nanswer A' (s, q') that this particular student would give, while human experts predict their own expected wrong answer\nH'(s, q'). Both these predictions are explicitly conditioned on the observed student mistake from Phase 1.\nThis conditioning provides several key advantages:\nTheorem 7 (Prediction Differentiation). Given students s1, s2 with different misconceptions m1, m2 observed in Phase\n1, optimal predictions for Phase 2 will differ:\nA' (s1, q') \\neq A'(s2, q')\neven for the same question q'.\nProof. Unlike the unconditioned case where predictions converge to the population mode, conditioned predictions\nshould maximize:\nP(A'(s, q') chosen | A(s, q))\nThis probability differs based on the specific misconception demonstrated in Phase 1."}, {"title": "The Insufficiency of Unconditioned Single-Phase Testing", "content": "This conditioning forces the AI to demonstrate three crucial capabilities:\n1. Understanding individual student reasoning patterns from Phase 1 responses\n2. Generating new questions that test the same conceptual understanding\n3. Predicting how specific misconceptions will manifest in new contexts\nUnlike the unconditioned design, success in this framework cannot be achieved through simple population-level\nstatistics, as it requires modeling the cognitive processes of individual students. This deeper understanding of student\nreasoning pathways has direct implications for educational capabilities: an AI system that can accurately predict how a\nstudent's specific misconceptions will manifest across different problems is necessarily equipped to provide targeted\ntutoring interventions and personalized feedback. The ability to generate new questions that probe and predict individual\nmisconceptions demonstrates the AI system's capacity to construct adaptive learning sequences and deliver feedback\nthat addresses each student's particular cognitive challenges."}, {"title": "Conclusion", "content": "Our research establishes a novel two-phase framework for evaluating educational AI systems through their ability to\npredict specific student misconceptions.

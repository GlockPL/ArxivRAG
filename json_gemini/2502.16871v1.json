{"title": "Utilizing Social Media Analytics to Detect Trends in Saudi Arabia's Evolving Market", "authors": ["Kanwal Aalijah"], "abstract": "Saudi Arabia' faced a swift economic growth and societal transformation under Vision 2030. This offers a\nunique opportunity to track emerging trends in the region, which will ultimately pave the way for new\nbusiness and investment possibilities. This paper explores how AI and social media analytics can identify\nand track trends across sectors such as construction, food and beverage, tourism, technology, and\nentertainment thereby helping the businesses make informed decisions. By leveraging a tailored AI-driven\nmethodology, we analyzed millions of social media posts each month, classifying discussions and\ncalculating scores to track the trends. The approach not only uncovered the emerging trends but also\nshows diminishing trends. Our methodology is able to predict the emergence and growth of trends by\nutilizing social media data. This approach has potential for adaptation in other regions. Ultimately, our\nfindings highlight how ongoing, AI- powered trend analysis can enable more effective, data- informed\nbusiness and development strategies in an increasingly dynamic environment.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is experiencing a rapid change from a vision 2030 perspective and this calls\nfor an assessment of the regional market trends at different points in time. One of the objectives of vision\n2030 is to further foster economic diversification by reducing oil revenues and building new economies in\nconstruction and tourism. Moreover, the vision also expands up to the IT and communication sector, sports,\nentertainment and food & beverage [1]. Traditionally market surveys or interviews were used to assess the\ntrends. The traditional methodologies are static and, therefore, fail to capture trends and shifts in consumer\nminds and expectations [2]. Due to the active involvement of millions of users, social networks have turned\ninto a great source of data, that is capable of shedding light on the state of the market [3][4]. AI methods\nhave now made it possible to perform content analysis in depth and real-time. The results from these\nmethodologies can keep the businesses, investors, and policymakers informed of the changing dynamics in\nthe market business environments [5].\nBy using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and methodologies, vast amounts of unstructured\nsocial media data can be interpreted [5]. These methodologies can be deployed in Saudi Arabia where new\nsocio-economic initiatives are changing some of the industries, for example, tourism, ICT, and\nentertainment. This type of market analysis allows public and private organizations to apply NLP and\nunsupervised clustering algorithms [2] to social media in a way that is able to continuously monitor and\nanticipate shifting marketplace dynamics. Al methodology proposed in this paper can provide sector specific\nanalysis to stake holders and to understand the market trends at large. The analysis can help the institutions\nto make the right decisions. For this study data was collected from social media and NLP models such as\nBERT, HDBSCAN and Forecasting models were used to analyze the trends and to generate patterns. This\nframework can be extended to other regions as well, where the policy makers are studying the effects of new\npolicies on the sentiment and perception of general public. This kind of research can prove to be a valuable\nresource for understanding and capitalizing on economic, social, and technological shifts."}, {"title": "Literature Review", "content": "Traditional market research methods are now considered inadequate to cope with rapid changes in the\ndynamics of modern market. They are lagging behind the bilateral dynamics and volatility in the markets;\nespecially in the case of Saudi Arabia [2]. Traditional market research methodologies fail as they are unable\nto keep up with changes in consumer thoughts or sentiments in the high growth regions which are\nundergoing drastic socio-economic changes. With the help of AI, trends can now be analyzed efficiently in\nreal- time. This can be done through the data collected from social media networks [4]. The data collected\nfrom social media can be fed in to machine learning models which can identify patterns by clustering the\ndata and insights can be generated [6]. Advances in NLP especially in LLMs has now made it possible to\nunderstand the changing market and consumer dynamics [7]. Since the region is transforming hence\nconsumer behaviors bound to change, hence it is essential for Saudi Arabia to monitor trends. Most of the\ndata in KSA is generated in Arabic language. Applying models such as BERT [8] and AraBERT [9] has\nbeen shown to analyze modern Arabic unstructured text with greater accuracy [10].\nAI-based analytics are being used for trend analysis focusing on evolving customer habits and shifts in\nvarious sectors and industries[11]. Just like other countries, even in Saudi Arabia, social media serves as the\nbase line platform for public discourse. It serves as a tool to provide insights into sector- specific trends such\nas in tourism, construction, and food & beverage industry [12]. Data generated through social media\nplatforms can be fed in to machine learning models to generate insights and predictions. Models like Latent\nDirichlet allocation and BERTopic are generally use to understand the context and organize the unstructured\ndata [2]. Deeper understanding of consumer sentiment can be obtained by using new and advance deep\nlearning models such multimodal sentiment analysis [13]. These models are able to incorporate text and\nvisual content both. This will ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of consumer sentiment. It will be\nvery beneficial for the decision makers, if they have the ability to continuously monitor and analyze trends\nover time.\nThere is a dire need of an Al methodology, that can bridge the gap made by traditional research methods.\nThis methodology should be robust enough to track the sentiment, emotions of people towards an initiative\nor a problem under consideration. In this paper we propose a machine learning frame work that takes\nadvantages of various NLP models to generate insights, track sentiment thereby helping the business and\npolicy makers to better understand the evolving KSA socio economic market."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "A. Data Collection\nData was sourced from major social media platforms, including X, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.

Trend Popularity and growth trajectory metrics\nIn order to understand perception of public towards a trend, we consolidated the engagement (likes, shares,\nand comments) and sentiment metrics and proposed a formula that tracks the current popularity of a trend.\nBy using this metric we were able to measure a trend's relevance and potential for growth in upcoming years\n[11].\nplatforms were selected for their popularity and high engagement in Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, Saudi Arabic has\nvarious dialects which makes sentiment analysis difficult. These dialects, along with informal language and\nslang, often deviate from Modern Standard Arabic, adding complexity to language processing tasks. To\naddress this, we used AraBERT [9], a BERT [8] based models. AraBERT was used as it specialized for\nArabic, BERT was used to handle other languages. The reason for using BERT is it effectively handles\ndialectal variations and colloquial expressions commonly found in social media [10], and has been bench\nmarked against many traditional models and methodologies [9].\nAraBERT Model was fine-tuned on a dataset of regional Arabic language with training split into 80% for\ntraining, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing.

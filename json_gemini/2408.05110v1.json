Market specialists always try to increase sales to satisfy strategic beneficiaries. Sales growth in car industry depends on many factors. Some are recognized by professionals and some others are intangible. There are many attributes must be considered as empowering sales factors, and every company need to know which ones are more important in current situation in order to concentrate on improving its capabilities around those main factors. Numerous studies have been conducted in Iran about passenger car sales factors. Atafar et al (2008) studied main factors in car sales and found out quality and price is the most important ones. Khodadad hoseini et al (2003) applied an AHP technique and found the quality as the most effective subject in car sales in Iran.

They are successfully used in recognition, image processing, data comparison, prediction, and somehow optimization.\nNeural networks use different learning mechanisms such as supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

But in unsupervised learning there is no instructor, so the network itself organizes input data and tries to learn."}, {"title": "2.3 Self-Organizing Map", "content": "The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a fairly well-known neural network and indeed one of the most popular unsupervised learning algorithms invented by Finnish Professor Teuvo Kohonen in the early 1980s. The maps comprehensively visualize natural groupings and relationships in the data and have been successfully applied in a broad spectrum of research areas ranging from speech recognition to financial analysis. Self-organizing networks have the ability to learn and detect regularities and correlations in the inputs, and predict responses from input data (Westerlund, 2005). A Self Organizing Map (SOM) is a single layer neural network, where neurons are set along an n-dimensional grid; typical applications assume a 2-dimensions rectangular grid. Each neuron has as many components as the input patterns: mathematically this implies that both neuron and inputs are vectors embedded in the same space. Training a SOM requires a number of steps to be performed in a sequential way. Unlike many other types of NNs, the SOM doesn't need a target output to be specified. Instead, where the node weights match the input vector, that area of the lattice is selectively optimized to more closely resemble the data for class of the input vector is a member of (Dragomir et al, 2014).\nFor a generic input pattern x we will have:\n1. To evaluate the distance between x and each neuron of the SOM;\n2. To select the neuron (node) with the smallest distance from x. We will call it winner neuron or Best Matching Unit (BMU). The algorithm used to find the \"winning\" neuron is a Euclidean distance calculation. That is, the \"winning\" neuron n of dimension d for sample input v (also of dimension d) would be the one which minimized the equation:\n$\\sqrt{\\sum_{i = 0}^{d}(n_i-v_i)^2}$  (2.1)\n3. To correct the position of each node according to the results of Step 2, in order to preserve the network topology. The amount to adjust each \"neighbor\" by is determined by the following formula:\nn; (t + 1) = n; (t) + h* [v(t)-n(t)]\nn (t) = weight vector of neuron i at regression step t\nv (t) = input vector at regression step t\nh = neighborhood function (2.2)\nWeight vectors in the map in the neighborhood of the BMU are updated so that they move closer to the sample vector (see Figure 2):"}, {"title": "2.4. Fuzzy Logic and Fuzzy numbers", "content": "Fuzzy set theory was introduced by Lotfi Askarzadeh (Zadeh) in 1965. Fuzzy logic could be described in mathematics by allocating value to each possible affair in reference set. These values show membership function in fuzzy set. This membership function shows correspondence, similarity, or adaptive capability of that element to the concept which is presented in fuzzy set. In other words, fuzzy sets provide flexible membership function for each member of the set. In classic sets theory a member belongs to a set or not. So, they call such sets \"crisp sets\". But in fuzzy sets many membership functions (between zero and one) is allowed. Therefore, membership function \u00b5a(x) in fuzzy set writes each member of fuzzy reference set into the interval [0 1], just like a pattern. A fuzzy number (see figure 3) is a generalization of a regular, real number in the sense that it does not refer to one single value but rather to a connected set of possible values, where each possible value has its own weight between 0 and 1. Triangular and trapezoid fuzzy numbers are defined as following equations:\n$\\mu_f(x)=\\begin{cases}\\frac{x-l}{m-l}&l<x<m\\\\ \\frac{u-x}{u-m} &m<x<u\\\\0 & \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$ (2.3)\n$\\mu_M(x) = \\begin{cases}\\frac{x-l}{m-l}&l<x<m\\\\1&m<x<n \\\\ \\frac{n-x}{n-u} &n<x<u\\\\0 & \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}$ (2.4)"}, {"title": "2.5.

Although, in this research we could select the critical variables through the traditional statistical analysis methods, Delphi method was used as a stronger methodology to achieve consensus of our market managers on final variables set. Okoli and Pawlowski (2004) compared and contrasted the strengths and weaknesses of a Delphi study versus the traditional survey approach as a research strategy (Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004)."}, {"title": "3.

The research has been conducted in three stages."}, {"title": "3.2 Model development", "content": "Iran khodro Company is the largest auto maker in middle-east with more than 550000 annual productions, and produces vast variety of cars with different types. Finding the most factors which cause sales growth would help the car manufacturer to adopt best marketing strategy. Because there are many factors which increase sales amount and finding main factors among them is so hard regarding large scale data, we decided to employ fuzzy Delphi method to identify the most effective factors. Delphi method is used for the following reasons:\nFirstly our study is an investigation of factors that would affect customer behavior in Iran market. This special subject requires expert people who understand the different attributes of our market structure. Thus, a Delphi method answers the research questions more appropriately. Secondly our sample size for an acceptable statistical analysis is small therefore, and also we encounter a problem which is lack of professionals in market analysis, in these conditions, Delphi technique will lead to more correct results. Finally among other group decision analysis methods Delphi is more suitable because it does not require the experts to meet physically, it save time and cost required for collecting expert's opinions. The traditional Delphi method has always suffered from low convergence expert opinions, high performance cost, and the possibility that opinion organizers may filter out particular expert opinions (Murry, Pipino, & Gigch, 1985). Thus we decided to propose the concept of integrating the traditional Delphi method and fuzzy theory to improve the vagueness and ambiguity of Delphi method. Hsu and Yang (2000) adopted triangular fuzzy number to gather expert opinions and establish Fuzzy Delphi method. The max and min values of expert opinions are taken as the two terminal points of triangular fuzzy numbers, and the geometric mean is taken as the membership degree of triangular fuzzy numbers to derive the statistically unbiased effect and avoid the impact of extreme values.\nThis method may create better results in criteria selection. It benefits the advantage of simplicity, and all the expert opinions can be involved in one investigation (Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004). \u03a4\u03bf make triangular fuzzy number for each input variable following equations were used:\nIaj = (Laj,Maj,UAj) (3-1)\nLaj = min (Xaij) (3-2)\nUAj = max (Xaij) (3-3)\n$MAj = \\sqrt[n]{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} XA\u0456\u0458}$ (3-4)\nEq. (3-1) represents triangular fuzzy number of jth variable. Laj is the minimum value of Aj that is evaluated by experts. Uaj is the maximum value of Aj that is evaluated by experts. Maj is geometric mean of expert evaluation from Aj, and Xaij is the evaluation of ith expert from ith variable. Geometric mean of each triangular number relates to consensus of experts on the value of variable. If the geometric mean is more than a predefined threshold the variable will be selected. For the threshold value r, the 80/20 rule was adopted (Kuo & Chen, 2007) with r set as 4. This indicated that among the factors for selection, \u201c20% of the factors account for an 80% degree of importance of all the factors\u201d.\nThe Fuzzy Delphi questionnaire in our study consists of a list of 10 variables frequently mentioned in sales factor literature. The questionnaire was distributed to fifteen managers of the sales, marketing and after sales service units. The respondents were asked to indicate to what extend each variable influences customer buying behavior, according to their contact with automobile customers.\nConsidering fuzzy numbers, ten variables identified as the most effective factors on the consensus of market experts.

Regarding our sample size, 10 variables were introduced to the software as inputs and the number of samples was 98. Network size has been adjusted to a 10 * 10 grid to provide clarity in diagrams. Therefore, the output layer of the artificial network was a 100-neuron network. Initial weights of network were randomly assigned. Sequential training algorithm and Gaussian neighborhood function were used for training process. Training was performed in two steps. In the first phase, relatively large initial learning rate and neighborhood radius were used. In the second step both learning rate and neighborhood radius was small just from the beginning. These steps are designed to tune the SOM approximately according to input data space and then they fine tune the self-organizing map. Number of epochs adjusted to 200 iterations, it means training procedure occurred 200 times and then system stopped. Training method was based on batch weigh processing and performance calculated according to mean squared error method (MSE). The mean squared error (MSE) of an estimator measures the average of the squares of the \"errors\", that is, the difference between the estimator and what is estimated."}, {"title": "3.3.4. Visualization; software outpoot", "content": "For SOM training, the weight vector associated with each neuron moves to become the center of a cluster of input vectors. In addition, neurons that are adjacent to each other in the topology should also move close to each other in the input space, therefore it is possible to visualize a high-dimensional inputs space in the two dimensions of the network topology. Variable maps reveal knowledge underlying in customers data. Elementary visualization technique was firstly introduced by Ultsch and Siemon (1990). In this method relating to each attribute value in the weight vector, a RGB (Red\u2013Green\u2013Blue) vector and consequently a color is considered in a way that all values can be shown in a colored spectrum from dark blue (for lowest values) to dark red (for highest values). In this way, for each attribute, the color of each neuron is identified and the map related to that attribute is obtained. In 2015 version of MATLAB software which is used in our study dark red colors represent large weights and light colors represent small weights. Black ones represent weight zero. With the attribute's maps, it is then possible to evaluate the mutual relation between them, this would be correlation test. The same color of the corresponding parts of two maps indicates the correlation of the corresponding attributes in those maps.\nThe intensity of color's difference or similarity between maps can show the correlation rate between two variables in different parts of the space.

The red lines connect neighboring neurons. The colors in the regions containing the red lines indicate the distances between neurons. The darker colors represent larger distances, and the lighter colors represent smaller distances. The SOM network appears to have clustered the dataset into ten distinct groups.

An interesting visualization way is to plot a hit histogram. SOM sample hits diagram reports number of hits which are attracted to neurons (nodes) in 100-neuron network. In this figure each hexagonal represents a neuron and each neuron is neighboring at most sex neurons. This useful figure can tell you how many data points are associated with each neuron.

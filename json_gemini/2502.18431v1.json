In this paper, we introduce TEXTGAMES, an innovative benchmark specifically crafted to assess LLMs through demanding text-based games that require advanced skills in pattern recognition, spatial awareness, arithmetic, and logical reasoning. Our analysis probes LLMs' performance in both single-turn and multi-turn reasoning, and their abilities in leveraging feedback to correct subsequent answers through self-reflection. Our findings reveal that, although LLMs exhibit proficiency in addressing most easy and medium-level problems, they face significant challenges with more difficult tasks.

This skill emphasizes the need for creating LLMs capable of handling tasks such as mathematical (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Shao et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024), commonsense (Talmor et al., 2019; Geva et al., 2021; Brohan et al., 2023), and symbolic reasoning (Nye et al., 2021; Sprague et al., 2024). In general, reasoning is a multifaceted ability that involves understanding the context and effectively applying inference to solve problems. Research on LLMs has examined their reasoning capabilities across various dimensions, including their capacity to follow instructions for multi-hop reasoning (Yang et al., 2024b), comprehend psychological concepts (Almeida et al., 2024), and use context in classification tasks (Winata et al., 2024), and constrained logical tasks (Zhou et al., 2023). LLMs have also demonstrated remarkable skills in game reasoning, such as solving crossword puzzles (Berruti et al., 2024; Saha et al., 2024; Zugarini et al., 2024), physics-based puzzle games (Oh et al., 2024), and turn-based games (Feng et al., 2024; Guo et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "2 TEXTGAMES BENCHMARK", "content": "We introduce our benchmark TEXTGAMES, which comprises eight text-based puzzle games, each featuring three distinct levels of difficulty, aimed at evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs. These games are meticulously designed to assess a wide array of reasoning skills, encompassing both abductive and deductive reasoning.

These rules involve generating text based on character counts, incorporating English alphanumeric characters, distinguishing between uppercase and lowercase letters, and including special characters and Roman numerals. Additionally, we introduce more complex tasks that require commonsense knowledge, such as identifying the capital city or continent of a specified country. Furthermore, we add simple arithmetic constraints, such as \"The text must include a number equal to seven times six.\""}, {"title": "2.1.3 Bracket Game", "content": "Given a concatenation of several English words, the player is tasked with enclosing segments of the text using four different types of parentheses: \u2018[]', '{}', '()', and \u2018<>'.

The player must fill only the blank cells, leaving the pre-filled cells unchanged. We utilize grids with N equal to 2 and 3, meaning the numbers range from 1 to 4 and 1 to 9, respectively. Alternatively, these numbers can be substituted with unique characters; for instance, we experiment with using Latin alphabets 'A' to 'I' in place of numbers 1 to 9."}, {"title": "2.1.7 Islands", "content": "Given a grid size of N, along with a specified set of rules, the player must construct an $N \\times N$ square grid using the characters '.', '#', or 'o', which represent water, land, and coconut trees, respectively.

The scoring rules encompass checks for the presence of specific character sequence patterns, the length of the words, as well as the prefixes and suffixes of the words. Points in each scoring rule can range from -100 to 100."}, {"title": "2.2 Challenges and Difficulty Levels", "content": "For comprehensive details about the games, including formats, categories, and the reasoning skills required, please refer to Table 1. Each game is designed with three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard, with specifics available in Table 2. The difficulty escalates through factors like the increased size of a 2D board, more stringent constraints, and progressively challenging reasoning tasks. Most games are designed to support multiple solutions, which can vary with the difficulty level. For instance, in Anagram Scribble (2.1.1), the same set of characters can be rearranged to create different English words, such as \u201cgame\u201d and \"mega.\" In Islands (2.1.7), the location of coconut trees can be arbitrary. In contrast, Ordering Text (2.1.8) offers only one possible solution, as words with the same score are sorted lexicographically."}, {"title": "2.3 Game Categories", "content": "The benchmark tasks can be divided into two categories: 1D and 2D formats. The 1D puzzles include Anagram Scribble (see Section 2.1.1), Password Game (see Section 2.1.2), Bracket Game (see Section 2.1.3), and String Search (see Section 2.1.4). In contrast, the 2D puzzles demand spatial awareness and the capacity to track values across multiple rows. These include Crossword Arranger (see Section 2.1.5), Text Sudoku (see Section 2.1.6), Islands (see Section 2.1.7), and Ordering Text (see Section 2.1.8). Generally, models demonstrate superior performance on 1D puzzles. For instance, the performance of LLMs on easy 2D puzzles is comparable to their performance on medium-difficulty 1D puzzles, while their performance on medium 2D puzzles parallels that on hard 1D puzzles. This is illustrated in Figure 1, highlighting the challenges LLMs face with 2D spatial reasoning."}, {"title": "2.4 Game Generation", "content": "For each game, we create instances by randomly sampling according to the specified rules for each difficulty level, resulting in 1,000 test samples per difficulty. This amounts to a total of 24,000 test samples across all games and difficulty levels. Additionally, we generate a number of training samples for few-shot learning across all difficulties, ensuring that these samples do not overlap with the test set. We refer to the test samples as $\\mathcal{D}_{test}$ and the training samples as $\\mathcal{D}_{train}$."}, {"title": "3 TEXTGAMES Evaluation", "content": "For our TEXTGAMES, we design a game evaluation framework where LLMs emulate player behavior to play the games. This system uses a LLM to generate solutions and integrates a grader to verify their correctness. To further test models' performance, we implement multi-turn prompting, enabling the model to iteratively refine its responses. This iterative process involves receiving feedback from the grader, which allows the models to self reflect and attempt to correct the answers."}, {"title": "3.1 Prompt Generation", "content": "We utilize in-context learning prompts to generate answers and evaluate the capabilities of LLMs under two configurations: zero-shot and one-shot prompts. Our prompt is defined as $P \\leftarrow (T, C, E, I)$, where it is constructed using a prompt template T, along with constraints C, one-shot examples E, and relevant context I from previous interactions for multi-turn scenarios. We denote the LLMs used for inference as $\\theta$ and the grader that evaluates the correctness of the answers as G. Detailed information about the prompts for each game is provided in Appendix H."}, {"title": "3.2 Multi-Turn Prompting", "content": "Algorithm 1 outlines the procedure for implementing multi-turn prompting, a strategy that iteratively refines responses based on feedback from a grader. At each turn, the model generates a response given the test constraint, few-shot examples, and previous interactions. The grader evaluates the response and provides feedback if errors are detected. The interaction history is updated with both the response and feedback, allowing the model to adjust its outputs in subsequent turns. The process terminates early if the grader confirms a correct response, ensuring adaptability while enabling iterative refinement. A complete list of feedback for all games can be found in Appendix J."}, {"title": "4 Experimental Setup", "content": "For each task described in Section 2, we begin by developing a grader to verify the correctness of the answers. These graders function similarly to those used on online judge platforms or in competitive programming contests, focusing solely on determining whether an answer is correct or incorrect. Subsequently, we evaluate the performance of various LLMs using these graders. Additionally, we have created a web-based platform to collect data for testing human performance on the same tasks, allowing for a comprehensive comparison between human and model capabilities."}, {"title": "4.1 Models", "content": "We employ several open-sourced LLMs known for their competitive performance on various benchmarks, including Gemma-2 9B and 27B Instruct (Team et al., 2024), Llama-3.1 8B Instruct, Llama-3.3 70B Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024), and the Qwen-2.5 instruct models of different scales (7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B) (Yang et al., 2024a). Additionally, we include proprietary closed models like GPT-40 Mini and GPT-30 Mini, given that mini models offer a good balance between performance and cost efficiency. For model inference, we implement greedy decoding to maintain deterministic outcomes. Specifically, for GPT-03 Mini, we configure the settings to prioritize the shortest reasoning generation option. We use accuracy or solve rate as our evaluation metric to measure the correctness of the answer."}, {"title": "4.2 Human Annotation", "content": "To understand how humans play and to compare their abilities with those of LLMs, we develop a web-based interface that enables human participants to engage with our games. Through this platform, we document interactions between participants and our grading system, capturing metrics such as solve rates, the number of attempts, and the time taken to solve. These data allow us to directly compare human capabilities to those of LLMs. Each participant is asked to solve 2 to 3 different sessions. Details regarding the demographics of the annotators are available in Appendix E."}, {"title": "5 Results and Analysis", "content": "Our findings indicate that our benchmark poses a considerable challenge for LLMs. Even at the easiest difficulty level, the majority of models struggle to solve the games. An exception is the highly capable GPT-03 Mini, which succeeds on only a subset of the games. This highlights the persistent difficulty of our benchmark for LLMs, highlighting areas where further advancements are needed.\nModel Scaling Improves Performance. Larger models generally exhibit superior performance, particularly when comparing models within the same family (e.g., Gemma-2 9B vs. 27B Instruct), where the larger model consistently outperforms its smaller counterpart. Notably, the Gemma-2 27B Instruct model remains highly competitive despite being significantly smaller than other 70B+ baselines. Typically, larger models excel on easier tasks; however, this advantage does not necessarily extend to more challenging tasks, such as those requiring reasoning in two-dimensional coordinates. This trend is illustrated in Figure 6 in the Appendix.\nMulti-Turn Feedback Improves LLM Performance. While LLMs typically underperform on single-turn attempts, we observe noteworthy improvements when they receive feedback explaining why their previous responses were incorrect. These enhancements are most evident at the easy difficulty level. Figures 4 and 7 illustrate this positive trend, showcasing how LLMs effectively use feedback from previous interactions to engage in self-reflection and refine their subsequent outputs. A similar trend is evident in the results for various models, as shown in Table 3 for 1D games and Table 4 for 2D games.\nTEXTGAMES Are Solvable by Humans. When comparing LLM performance to human performance, we observe that humans can easily achieve full scores, especially on the easy difficulty. This is because some problems, particularly at lower difficulty levels, are arguably trivial for adult humans. On average, humans could solve all the problems within 2 attempts except for Ordering Text on the medium difficulty. This finding is particularly interesting given that recent research suggests LLMs exhibit intelligence seemingly on par with humans (Achiam et al., 2023). Yet, these models struggle with tasks as simple as searching for a substring and placing a bracket around it or constructing a 2D string with a predefined number of \"islands.\" At higher difficulty levels, we observe a decline in human performance, reflected in the lower one-turn solve rate and increased time required to solve. However, while LLMs exhibit a similar trend, most models fail to solve any hard problems, whereas humans still manage to solve them in one turn.\nMisaligned Difficulty Perception between LLMs and Humans. The \"Islands\" and \"String Search\" games are among the easiest problems for humans; even at the hardest difficulty, humans typically solve them in fewer than two turns, making them some of the fastest problems to complete. In contrast, LLMs struggle significantly with these tasks, generally exhibiting subpar performance. This highlights a discrepancy in difficulty perception between humans and LLMs and sheds light on the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMS approach constrained puzzle-solving.\nInverse-Scaling on Reasoning Length and Performance Previous studies have generally shown that longer reasoning sequences enhance performance. Interestingly, this pattern is not evident in GPT-03 Mini (Figure 5). We observe that GPT-03 Mini tends to produce incorrect answers more frequently with extended reasoning tokens, particularly in the Bracket Game, Islands, and Ordering Text. Although GPT-03 Mini does not disclose its reasoning process, we hypothesize that it may become confused by its own extended reasoning, resulting in overcomplicated solutions or incorrect understanding. An empirical example is illustrated by the recent DeepSeek R1 hallucination, where the system initially provided a correct answer but, after further analysis and reasoning, can be misled into an incorrect conclusion, shown in Table 26 in the Appendix I."}, {"title": "6 Related Work", "content": "Games using LLMs. With the advancement of LLMs, recent works examine their capabilities in playing games or assisting humans in gameplay (Hu et al., 2024a). Classical games like Go (Silver et al., 2017), chess (Feng et al., 2024), Poker (Huang et al., 2024a) have been used as initial testbeds for evaluating models' planning and decision-making abilities. More recently, more works have explored other genres for more dynamic and complex situations like text-based games (Xiao and Yang, 2024; Stojanovski, 2024; Kazemi et al., 2024), communication games (Guan et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025), and modern strategic video games (Zhang et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024b; Qi et al., 2024; Rao et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2025). In comparison, TEXTGAMES takes inspiration from real-life text puzzle games and emphasizes evaluating LLM's capabilities in simple logic reasoning. Additionally, each game come with different level of difficulty for assessing the models' robustness.\nText-based Reasoning. Text-based reasoning has been extensively studied across various domains, including commonsense reasoning (Rajani et al., 2019; Bhargava and Ng, 2022; Zhao et al., 2023), mathematical reasoning (Patel et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023), logical reasoning (Pan et al., 2023), causal reasoning (Wang, 2024; Jin et al., 2024), and agent-based reasoning (Motwani et al., 2024). While existing benchmarks assess different aspects of reasoning, they often evaluate these abilities in isolation. In contrast, TEXTGAMES assesses LLMs' capacity for integrating multiple reasoning skills, offering a richer evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses."}, {"title": "7 Conclusion", "content": "We present TextGames, a text-based puzzle game benchmark designed to evaluate the diverse reasoning abilities of LLMs, including pattern recognition, spatial awareness, arithmetic, and logical reasoning. In addition to only evaluating single-turn solve rate, our evaluation system also implement feedback in multi-turn gameplay settings and test whether models improve through self-reflection. Results show that while LLMs proficiently solve most easy and medium-level problems, they encounter significant challenges with more difficult tasks that demand comprehensive reasoning. In contrast, humans can solve all tasks given sufficient time. We show significant performance improvement with multi-turn prediction via self-reflection. We hope TEXTGAMES could contribute to uncovering and analyzing the weaknesses of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks."}, {"title": "Limitations", "content": "In this paper, we focus our investigation by not exhaustively evaluating every possible model, owing to resource constraints.

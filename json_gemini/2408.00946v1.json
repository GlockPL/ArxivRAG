INTRODUCTION", "content": "Uncertainty is one of the greatest determinants of AI research landscapes and applications. The significance of uncertainty as an inevitable element to consider when unlocking the full potential of artificial intelligence technologies grows exponentially with advances made within this field across various sectors. In other words, uncertainty is a characteristic of the real world. It touches on all aspects of human life. The existence of artificial intelligence (AI) relies on the ability to understand and manage uncertainty effectively in order to build dependable, resilient, and adaptive (intelligent) systems. There are different forms in which uncertainty appears: from incomplete or noisy data to situations that can have multiple outcomes at once. Uncertainty must be addressed not as an abstract concept but as a practical necessity since AI systems often function within volatile and ambiguous conditions where choices have to be made based on imperfect information. Furthermore, the importance of uncertainty in AI cannot be underestimated. In other words, AI seeks human-like intelligence meaning it is reasoning, inferring, and making decisions even when there is no complete certainty involved. For example, autonomous vehicles could negotiate with unpredictable traffic jams while medical diagnosis programs may interpret vague symptoms to suggest possible treatments for them. In these scenarios, AI models have to deal with uncertainties before they can come up with correct and well-founded judgments that are also safe enough [1].\nAdditionally, uncertainty characterises every phase in the entire pipeline of AI including data preprocessing; feature engineering; model training/testing/evaluation/deployment.\nBesides, uncertainty is all over AI pipeline stages involving data preprocessing and feature engineering, model training and analysis and deployment. In AI approaches that are data-driven, uncertainty comes from inherent uncertainty in the data, sampling variability, imperfect models, or model approximation errors. Even in rule-based or symbolic AI systems, however, any conclusions will be affected by uncertainty based on the complexity of real-world phenomena as well as human reasoning. This paper brings together succinctly important phenomena, approaches, as well as new directions taken by AI systems to deal with uncertainty as they are found in Kanal [1].\nThis paper is motivated by a growing understanding of the new definition of total uncertainty defined by two types of uncertainties in machine learning-Epistemic and Aleatoric uncertainties, explained in Section II."}, {"title": "A. Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties", "content": "The importance of understanding and quantifying uncertainty in machine learning has increased significantly. A proper understanding of the uncertainty framework that defines the types of optimisation problems is important and we encounter them in this paper. Therefore, a proper delimiting of the scope as well as understanding of the underlying ideas of the selected concepts and their impact on the loss function to be optimised is necessary. This is primarily due to the growing complexity of AI applications and the rapid growth of data. The need to address this demand arises from the unpredictable nature of utilising AI in diverse domains, including safety-critical areas like healthcare and autonomous systems, to more business-related such as finance and marketing. Machine learning has the potential to revolutionise various industries. However, it also poses inherent risks, particularly in terms of generalisation, domain adaptation, and making safe decisions in many applications, e.g., control and decision making. To tackle this problem, researchers have been continuously developing uncertainty quantification methods in AI. Unlike standard machine learning algorithms, an advanced uncertainty-equipped machine learning algorithm provides us with a set of predictions for possible outputs instead of a single point prediction. This ability to return a set of possible outcomes helps us to make better and safer decisions in different scenarios. In this section, we primarily give an overview of different methods and algorithms that enable machine learning methods to quantify and approximate uncertainty. Several methods that we cover in this section, include direct interval prediction, ensemble models, Bayesian methods, Random sets & Belief function models, and conformal prediction. We mainly discuss these four methods due to their popularity.\nAleatoric uncertainty: Aleatoric (statistical) uncertainty (AU) refers to randomness or variability: What a random sample drawn from a probability distribution will be.\nEpistemic uncertainty: Epistemic (systematic) uncertainty (EU) refers to the lack of knowledge: What is the relevant probability distribution?"}, {"title": "B. Total uncertainty", "content": "In machine learning, the total uncertainty (TU) is defined by [2],\n$TU = EU + AU$.\n(1)\nThe definition (1) is correct when the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties are independent. As a simple example, the mean of two entities could be different with different noise levels i.e., EU and AU are dependent and we need a better definition of total uncertainty. In the next Section III we explain a new definition for TU and an overview of advanced (imprecise) uncertainty models."}, {"title": "II. UNCERTAINTY MODELS AND IDENTIFICATIONS", "content": "In this section, we focus on an overview of the analytical concepts of some advanced uncertainty models that we use in WP2, e.g., intervals, random sets, probability intervals, and credal sets. We explain the essential ideas behind the concepts. These advanced models are set models and deal with in-determinism in the uncertainty (second-order uncertainty).\nIn general, and specifically in engineering and machine learning domains, uncertainty is defined in two categories: aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty arises from the inherent randomness in the data, and it is irreducible. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty arises from the lack of information or data which is reducible (by gathering more data).\nIn this section, our focus is on integrating epistemic uncertainty models into the optimisation problems under uncertainty. The goal is to investigate different types of epistemic uncertainty models for the optimisation problem under uncertainty that enables \u201cpointwise\u201d optimisation under epistemic uncertainty. While robust and stochastic optimisation methods are commonly employed in dealing with optimisation under the Bayesian uncertainty, they fail to account for predicting epistemic uncertainty with acceptable accuracy. By incorporating epistemic uncertainty models, we can enhance the optimisation process by accounting for the lack of information or data. To model the epistemic uncertainty, we propose several epistemic uncertainty models such as the (probabilistic) interval model, random set, and credal set models.\n1) Deterministic Intervals: The deterministic interval model\u2014also called vacuous previsions\u2014 expresses ignorance relative to a non-empty subset of possible parameter values. The interval model is the least informative model. The interval representation only needs the lower and upper values of an uncertain parameter. Hence, the knowledge of the probabilistic distribution over the parameters between its lower and upper value is not required. Mathematically, an interval model is written as X = [X, X].\nThe interval model, also known as vacuous expectation, represents ignorance regarding a nonempty subset of possible parameter values. In state-of-the-art problems, the Interval arithmetic attempts to propagate the interval through the problem to find a resulting interval, aiming to calculate the upper and lower bounds of this propagated interval. However, precise calculation of these bounds can be challenging or even impossible, and the complexity of this method for higher-dimensional e.g., optimisation problems is NP-hard [3, 4].\nThe lower and upper expectations for a subset A of \u03a9 and for a given functional g := g(Y) of the random variable Y : A \u2192 R are defined as follows:\nInterval Model\n$E(g) := inf_{g|A} gA$ and $E(g) := sup_{g|A} g|A$.\n(2)\nWhen A := [a, b] \u2282 \u03a9 := R (one-dimensional case) and g(y) is a continuous function on y \u2208 [a, b], the lower and upper expectations are defined as:\n$E(g) = min_{y \\in [a,b]} g(y)$ and $E(g) = max_{y \\in [a,b]} g(y)$.\n(3)\nThis model effectively represents the available information when it is known that Y assumes values in A but no further probabilistic information is available, other than P(A) = 1.\n2) Probability Intervals: In classification of C elements, probability intervals can be defined as [Y, Y] = {[Yk, Yk]}C_{k=1}, where 0 \u2264 Yk \u2264 Yk \u2264 1 . They represent the lower and upper bounds of the probabilities associated with the relevant classes.\n3) \u03f5-contaminations: This model is more advanced than the two previous models\u2014interval and probability intervals. It is easy to build as well as implement compared to the other uncertainty models such as a possibility distribution model. The contamination model is a mixed/hybrid model, which is built by two simple models\u2014a non-probabilistic model such as interval and a probabilistic model such as a probability distribution. The state-of-the-art of the mixed models is mainly focused on Bayesian sensitivity analysis and not much attention has been paid to non-deterministic advanced uncertainty cases\nAn \u03f5-contamination model E(\u00b7) is described as a convex combination of two uncertainty models: (i) Probabilistic/precise model, e.g., Normal distribution with expectation E, (ii) non-probabilistic/imprecise model, e.g., interval model with lower expectation E\u2081, defined in (3). For a gamble f \u2208 G(\u03a9) the lower expectation is described as follows:\nContamination model\n$E(f) = (1 \u2013 \u03f5)E(f) + \u03f5E\u2081(f)$ (4)\nwhere $M{E}{E : \u2200f \u2208 G(\u03a9), E(f) \u2265 E\u2081(f)}$ is the set of dominating linear expectations by E\u2081. By definition (2), the lower and upper expectation for a given interval [a, b] is defined as\n$E\u2081(f(y)) = inf_{y \\in [a,b]} f(y)$ and $E1(f(y)) = sup_{y \\in [a,b]} f(y)$.\n(5)\n0 < \u03f5 < 1 is called (in this dissertation) a tuning parameter or level of model-trust/importance. Similarly, the upper expectation is\n$E(f) = (1 \u2013 \u03f5)E(f) + \u03f5E1(f)$.\n(6)\n4) Credal Sets: A credal set is defined as a convex set of probability distributions. One of the computationally effective ways to construct a credal set, denoted as Q, is to use probability intervals, as follows:\n$Q={y = (y1, \u2026\u2026\u2026,YC)|Yk\u2208 [yk,yk], Vk=1, 2, ..., C}$,\n(7)\nin which y represents a single probability distribution vector. Here, Q is a special convex set (a polytope) of probabilities constrained by probability intervals. To prevent Q from being empty, [y, y] is required to satisfy the following condition [11]:\n$\u03a3C_{k=1} Yk \u2264 1 \u2264 \u03a3C_{k=1} yk$\n(8)\nWhen a neural network prediction assumes the form of a credal set Q (CredNN), an extension of Shannon entropy has been proposed to measure the uncertainty [12],\nH* = max H(y), H* = min H(y),\ny\u2208Q\ny\u2208Q\n(9)\nin which H* and H* denote the upper and lower Shannon entropy, and serve as the measure for"}, {"title": "the total (TU) and aleatoric uncertainty (AU), respectively. Epistemic uncertainty (EU) is then measured by the difference H* \u2014H*.", "content": "5) Random Sets: In a traditional classifier like a neural network, the output is a mapping from input data to a single category. However, in set-valued classification, the output is a mapping from the input data to a set of possible categories. For instance, instead of predicting a single class, a set-valued classifier might predict multiple potential classes for a given input. In set-valued classification, the prediction for each input is not a vector of softmax probabilities as in traditional classification. Instead, it's a belief function, where each output corresponds to a subset of possible classes. For example, if there are N classes, a basic set-valued classifier would have 2^N outputs, each representing a different combination of classes. To overcome the exponential complexity of using 2^N sets of classes (especially for large N), a fixed budget of K relevant non-singleton (of cardinality > 1) focal sets are used. These focal sets are obtained by clustering the original classes and selecting the top K sets of classes with the highest overlap ratio, computed as the intersection over union for each subset. The clustering is performed on feature vectors of images of each class generated by a standard CNN trained on the original classes. The feature vectors are further reduced to 3 dimensions using t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding) before applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to them. Ellipsoids, covering 95% of data, are generated using eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and the mean vector obtained from the GMM to calculate the overlaps. To avoid computing a degree of overlap for all subsets, the algorithm is early stopped when increasing the cardinality does not alter the list of most overlapping sets of classes. The non-singleton focal sets so obtained, along with the 2^N original (singleton) classes, form our network outputs E.g., in a 100-class scenario, the power set contains subsets (1030 possibilities). Setting a budget of K = 200, for instance, results in 100 + K = 300 outputs, a far more manageable number.\n6) Probability Box: Another advanced and highly informative uncertainty model is the (generalised) probability box or p-box. When multiple"}, {"title": "cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) from a database or experiment are available but a true distribution cannot be determined, they can be collected into a bounded set known as a p-box.", "content": "In real-life scenarios, such as those involving numerous disturbances and a rapidly changing environment, finding a true distribution model can be challenging. In such cases, modelling uncertainty via a single unique distribution is impractical. However, with sufficient data, lower and upper distribution functions can be defined, within which any estimated distribution must lie.\nA p-box is a set of all distributions bounded by the lower and upper distribution functions. Mathematically, a (generalised) p-box is defined as a set of distributions bounded by a pair (F, F) of cumulative distribution functions mapping the sample space \u03a9 to [0, 1], satisfying F < F. If \u03a9 is a closed interval on R, the pair (F, F) is referred to as a p-box. Figure 2 illustrates a simple p-box with uniform distribution functions as the lower and upper bounds.\nThe CDF is any non-decreasing function F : \u03a9 \u2192 [0,1] that satisfies F(\u03a9) = 1, where \u03a9 is the largest member of \u03a9 and \u03a9 is the smallest. F(s) provides information about the cumulative probability on the interval [\u03a9, s]. Given a cumulative distribution F on \u03a9 and a value s \u2208 \u03a9, F(s+) is the right-limit and F(s-) is the left-limit, defined as follows:\nF(s+) = inf_{y>s} F(y) = lim_{y\u2192s,y>s} F(y),\nF(s-) = sup_{y<s} F(y) = lim_{y\u2192s,y<s} F(y).\nIn Walley's framework [13], a generalised p-box is interpreted as a lower expectation (actually a lower probability) $E_{F,F}$ on the set of events\nZ \u2282 \u03a9, Z := [\u03a9, \u03a9] = {[\u03a9, s] : s \u2208 \u03a9}\nU {(r, \u03a9] : r \u2208 \u03a9}\nas follows:\n$E_{F,F}([\u03a9, s]) := F(s)$,\n$E_{F,F}((r, \u03a9]) := 1 \u2013 F(r)$.\nCumulative distribution functions are not assumed to be right-continuous."}, {"title": "Limit Approximation of P-box", "content": "Consider a p-box (F, F) on \u03a9. Let {En}n, {Fn}n be increasing and decreasing sequences of CDFs converging point-wise to F and F, respectively. Assume En is the lower probability associated with (Fn, Fn). Since Fn < F and Fn > F, it follows that \u03a6(F, F) \u2286 \u03a6(Fn, Fn) and Equation (11) implies that En \u2264 E. Furthermore, En \u2264 En+1 for any n\u2208 N, so limn En = supn En \u2264 E. Thus, the natural extension can be approximated as follows: E(f) = limn En(f) for any gamble f.\nFor a given p-box model-illustrated in Figure 3 with the lower and upper bounds given by uniform distribution functions F and F-we can discretise the y-axes (probability) into n partitions, with Fn and Fn determined as follows:\n$F_n(y) = \begin{cases}  \\frac{i-1}{n}  & \\text{ if } y \\in L_i, y \\neq \u03a9 \\\\  \\frac{1}{n}  & \\text{ if } y = \u03a9  \\end{cases}$\n(12)\nFn(y) = i/n if y \u2208 Ui\nwhere n \u2208 N, i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, . . ., n} such that\n$U_i := F^{-1}([\\frac{i}{n},1])$,\n$L_i := F^{-1}([\\frac{1}{n},1])$.\nAs shown, any p-box model can be approximated via 2n intervals (Ui's and Li's). From the definition of the lower expectation under a discrete generalised p-box [15, 16], the approximations of the lower and upper expectations E : G(\u03a9) \u2194 R, E : G(\u03a9) \u2192 R for a gamble f\u2208 G(\u03a9) are given by:\n$E(f) = lim_{n\u2192\u221e} \\frac{1}{n}  \\sum_{i=1}^{n}  inf_{y\u2208Li}  f(y) = lim_{n\u2192\u221e} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} inf_{y\u2208Li} f(y)$,\n(13)\n$E(f) = lim_{n\u2192\u221e} \\frac{1}{n}  \\sum_{i=1}^{n}  sup_{y\u2208Ui}  f(y) = lim_{n\u2192\u221e} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} sup_{y\u2208Ui} f(y)$,\n(14)"}, {"title": "III.

If we remove some K-number of data points for instance from X2-meaning increasing the epistemic uncertainty in X2-then the noise level (\u03c32) in X2 will be different than \u03c31.

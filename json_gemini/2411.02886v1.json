However, this progress faces two major challenges: performance degradation due to sequence lengths out-of-distribution, and excessively long inference times caused by the quadratic computational complexity of attention. These issues hinder the application of LLMs in long-context scenarios. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Token-Level KV Cache Selection (TokenSelect), a model-agnostic, training-free method for efficient and accurate long-context inference. TokenSelect builds upon the observation of non-contiguous attention sparsity, using Query-Key dot products to measure per-head KV Cache criticality at token-level. By per-head soft voting mechanism, TokenSelect selectively involves a small number of critical KV cache tokens in the attention calculation without sacrificing accuracy. To further accelerate TokenSelect, we designed the Selection Cache based on observations of consecutive Query similarity and implemented efficient dot product kernel, significantly reducing the overhead of token selection. A comprehensive evaluation of TokenSelect demonstrates up to 23.84x speedup in attention computation and up to 2.28\u00d7 acceleration in end-to-end latency, while providing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art long-context inference methods.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the number of parameters is no longer the sole factor significantly affecting model performance. The ability to effectively process longer context information has become one of the key metrics for evaluating LLMs' capabilities. The latest Web applications such as cross-document understanding [1], LLM-powered search systems [2], repository-level code completion [3, 4], and complex reasoning [5] have all placed higher demands on the long-context abilities of LLMs. There are two main difficulties in using pre-trained LLMs for long-context inference. On one hand, LLMs are limited by their context length during pre-training (e.g. Llama 3 only has 8192 tokens)."}, {"title": "2 Related Works", "content": "Long-context LLMs. Due to computational complexity constraints, current LLMs based on Transformers often utilize limited context lengths during pre-training [9, 10, 22, 23, 25, 26]. To extend the long-context capabilities of LLMs, current methods can be broadly categorized into three approaches [27-29]: 1) Modifying positional encodings: A widely adopted method is positional interpolation [30]. Chen et al. first proposed linear scaling of ROPE [31] to map longer positional ranges within the original training window. Subsequent works [32, 33] further improved this method using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory [34], achieving longer context windows while maintaining model performance. Methods like YaRN [35] and Giraffe [36] optimize interpolation effects by adjusting frequency components or introducing temperature parameters. 2) Long-context post-training: This approach extends the model's context length through additional training steps on longer documents after pre-training [37, 38]. It has been widely adopted by leading LLMs [8-10] with the support of sequence parallelism techniques [39-41]. 3) Incorporating additional memory modules: Notable examples include Transformer-XL [42], Compressive Transformer [43], RMT [44] and Infini-attention [45]. Although these methods have expanded the context length of LLMs, long-context inference still faces the challenge of high computational costs.\nEfficient Long-context Inference. In state-of-the-art LLMs serving systems [18, 46-48], technologies such as Flash Attention [49, 50] and Paged Attention [46] have greatly optimized LLMs inference efficiency by improving GPU I/O bottlenecks. However, in long-context inference scenarios, the quadratic computational complexity of attention with respect to sequence length poses new challenges for LLMs inference. Numerous studies focus on the sparsity of attention, selecting partial KV Cache for attention calculations to improve long-context inference efficiency.

Each transformer layer includes a multi-head attention (MHA) module and a feed-forward networks (FFN) module. The inference process of LLMs can be divided into two stages: the Prefill Stage and the Decode Stage.\nThe Prefill Stage is the preparatory phase of the inference process. In this stage, the user's input is processed layer by layer through a single forward pass of LLMs, generating KV Cache for each layer. The generation of KV Cache is completed by the MHA module. Assuming $X_{prefill} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{in} \\times d}$ is the input of a transformer layer, where $n_{in}$ is the number of tokens in user's input sequence and $d$ is the hidden size. The computation of MHA in the Prefill Stage is as follows (simplified to single-head mode):\n$[Q_{prefill}, K_{prefill}, V_{prefill}] = X_{prefill} \\cdot [W_q, W_k,W_v]$,\n$O_{prefill} = softmax(\\frac{Q_{prefill} K_{prefill}^T}{\\sqrt{d}}) V_{prefill}$,\nwhere $W_q, W_k, W_v$ are linear projections, $[.]$ represents tensor concatenation operation, and Eq.(2) is also known as Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA).

Sparse attention can keep the number of tokens participating in attention computations at a constant scale, rather than increasing with sequence length. Given that predefined sparse patterns are detrimental to performance, we aim to dynamically select crucial tokens for attention computation at each step during the inference process. Therefore, we formalize this problem according to the following definition.\nDefinition 1 (Selective Sparse Attention Problem, informal). For current input of length C (C = 1 in the Decode Stage) and KV Cache of length N, assuming there are H attention heads with a head size of $d_h$, let O be the output of the SDPA:\n$O= softmax\\left(\\frac{Q^h \\cdot [K_{cache}^h, K_{current}^h]^T}{\\sqrt{d_h}} \\right) [V_{cache}^h, V_{current}^h]_{h \\in \\{1,...,H\\}}$,\nwhere $Q^h, K^h, V^h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times d_h}$ is the Query, Key, Value matrices of current input for head h and $K_{cache}^h, V_{cache}^h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_h}$ represent the KV Cache.

The selection of $K_{select}, V_{select}$ is performed by selection function $S$:\n$S(Q, K_{cache}) = I, where I \\in \\mathbb{P}(\\{1,\\cdots, N\\})$, Kselect = [(Kcache)i]i\u2208I, Vselect = [(Vcache)i]i\u2208I,\nwhere $I$ is the set of selected indices. The objective is to find an appropriate selection function $S$ that minimizes the difference between the outputs of the SDPA and the selective sparse attention:\n$\\min_{S} ||O - \\hat{O}||_2$."}, {"title": "4 Motivations and Observations", "content": "Attention is Sparse, Non-contiguous and Head-Distinctive. Previous works [6, 7, 11-17, 53] have demonstrated the sparsity of attention scores in LLMs, particularly when processing long texts. Recent approaches [15-17] partition the KV Cache into non-overlapping blocks, estimating block criticality for sparse attention calculations. These methods assume that tokens with higher attention scores tend to be contiguous. However, our further observations reveal that this assumption does not always hold true in practice. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, attention scores are sparsely distributed at the token-level, with critical tokens not necessarily contiguous. This non-contiguity leads to significant omissions in block-level token selection. Fig. 2b demonstrates that finer selection granularity improves recall of critical tokens, motivating us to perform token-level selection. For token-level selection, an intuitive approach would be to directly select the top-k tokens with the highest attention logits. However, observation in Fig. 2c reveals considerable disparity in the $L_1$ norm of attention logits across attention heads. As a result, the selection result tends to be dominated by a few heads with disproportionately large attention logits, driving us to design a more robust selection function that maintains the independence of heads.\nConsecutive Queries are similar. As sparsity of attention is dynamic [13, 15-17], token selection should be performed for every Query, which inevitably increases the computational overhead of selective sparse attention. Fortunately, we observe that consecutive Queries exhibit high similarity, as shown in Fig. 3a. Intuitively, when two consecutive Queries are highly similar, their dot products with the Keys will also be similar, leading to substantial overlap in the token selection results. Due to space constraints, we provide an informal lemma about this below. The formal version and corresponding proof can be found in the Appendix A.\nLemma 1 (Informal). Consider Queries $Q_1, Q_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}$ that are consecutive and a Key set $\\{K_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$. Let $I_1$ and $I_2$ be the sets of indices of the top-k Keys selected by dot product for $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ respectively. If $cos(Q_1, Q_2) > \\epsilon$, where $e$ is a threshold, then $I_1 \\approx I_2$.\nFig. 3b illustrates this lemma experimentally. It can be seen that the overlap rate of token selection tends to increase with query similarity. This key insight motivates us to reuse selection results for similar queries, improving computational efficiency. Moreover, the similarity distribution of consecutive Queries remains consistent"}, {"title": "5 Designs of TokenSelect", "content": "In this section, we will introduce the design details of TokenSelect, primarily encompassing the Selection Function, the Selection Cache, and efficient implementation of TokenSelect. The overall workflow of TokenSelect is illustrated in Fig. 4."}, {"title": "5.1 Selection Function", "content": "The simplest selection function is to determine the criticality of the tokens through the dot product of Q and $K_{cache}$, then select the top-k critical ones as $K_{select}$, $V_{select}$. The selected indices $I$ are calculated as follow:\n$I_{topk} = TopK(Q^h K_{cache}^h)$.\nHowever, as discussed in Sec. 4, this approach is prone to inaccuracies due to disparities in norm of attention logits between heads. To maintain independence between heads, a better approach is to have each head select the top-k most critical tokens, and then determine the final selection through voting among the heads:\n$I_{head-vote} = TopK(\\sum_{h=1}^{H} I(i \\in TopK(Q^h \\cdot K_{cache}^h)))$.\nwhere $I$ is the indicator function. Unfortunately, despite better performance, this method relies on scatter_add and multiple topk operations, resulting in low efficiency on GPUs. Additionally, the 0/1 voting ignores the relative importance of tokens for each head. Therefore, we propose a head soft vote approach that offers better performance and efficiency. Specifically, we first calculate the per-head criticality, then normalize through softmax, and sum the results for all heads. The formalization is as follows:\n$I_{head-soft-vote} = TopK(\\sum_{h=1}^{H} softmax(\\frac{Q^h K_{cache}^h}{\\sqrt{d_h}}))$."}, {"title": "5.2 Optimizing Selection Frequency", "content": "Although the aforementioned selection function can reduce the complexity of attention from $O(N^2)$ to $O(k^2)$ ($k \\ll N$), while maintaining performance, the execution time of the selection function itself still affects the latency of LLMs inference. To further accelerate long-context inference, based on our observations of the similarity of consecutive queries, we design optimization strategies for both the Prefill Stage and the Decode Stage to reduce the selection frequency while ensuring its effectiveness.\nIn the Prefill Stage, $Q_{prefill} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{in} \\times d}$ is inputed. In long-context scenarios, the number of tokens in the user's input sequence $n_{in}$ may reach up to 1M, making it impractical to perform selection for each Query token. Considering the similarity of consecutive Queries, we use chunk-wise token selection, inputting $\\sum_{i=1}^{c}(Q_{C})_i$ into the selection function, where $Q_C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{c \\times d}$ is the Query chunk and $c$ is the chunk size. This method helps maintain the compute-intensive nature of the Prefill Stage, preventing it from becoming memory bound.\nIn the Decode Stage, due to the auto-regressive characteristic of LLMs, we need to frequently perform selection for $Q_{decode} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}$,"}, {"title": "5.3 Efficient Implementation", "content": "To ensure that our proposed TokenSelect can be used for real-world Web applications, efficient implementation is crucial. We first analyze the computation time breakdown of representative block-level selective sparse attention method, InfLLM [15]. From (1)(2)(3) in Fig. 5, we can observe that although selective sparse attention can significantly reduce the complexity of attention calculations, the actual computation time is still highly dependent on the implementation. The incompatibility with efficient attention implementations such as Flash Attention has resulted in methods requiring historical attention scores [13-15, 53] being difficult to be applied in real-world Web applications. Through the analysis of InfLLM's Flash Attention-compatible version, we make several discoveries. The initial motivation for estimating token criticality at the block-level is to reduce the overhead of selection function (mainly considering dot product calculation). However, we find that dot product is not the primary performance bottleneck. Instead, a significant portion of the overhead comes from indexing the KV Cache using selected indices and making them contiguous in GPU memory, which frequently occurs during the updating of KV blocks and the concatenation of selected KV Cache. The extensive I/O required for this operation further exacerbates the memory-bound in LLMs inference. Based on this, we propose that Paged Attention is a more suitable implementation for selective sparse attention. Using Paged KV Cache management (with page size=1 for TokenSelect), we can reduce the I/O volume for selection results from the scale of all selected KV Caches O(2kd) to the scale of their indices O(k). However, by observing (4) in Fig. 5, we find that we encounter another bottleneck under Paged KV Cache management. Since logically contiguous KV Cache is not entirely contiguous in GPU memory, it also needs to be made contiguous before performing computational operations. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the concept of Paged Attention and implement a Paged Dot Product"}, {"title": "6 Experiments", "content": "In this section, we first introduce the experimental setup of this paper, and then reveal the performance and efficiency of our TokenSelect in long-context inference through experiments."}, {"title": "6.1 Experimental Settings", "content": "Datasets. To evaluate TokenSelect's performance on long-context inference, we use the following datasets: (1) InfiniteBench [20]: The mainstream long-context benchmark consisting of multi-tasks. The average length of it exceeds 200K tokens. (2) RULER [21]: A challenging long-context benchmark containing 13 different tasks, with subsets of varying lengths up to 128K tokens. (3) LongBench [1]: Another mainstream long-context benchmark comprising 6 types of tasks. The 95% percentile for its lengths is 31K tokens. For each dataset, we use its recommended metrics, which are presented in the Appendix B.\nBaselines. To demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of TokenSelect, we include the following methods for comparison: (1) Original models: We select three mainstream open-source LLMs - Qwen2-7B-Instruct [9], Llama-3-8B-Instruct [22], and Yi-1.5-6B-Chat [23] - utilizing their original context lengths without any modifications.

(5) InfLLM: The SOTA method for long-context inference and length extrapolation using a block-level selective sparse attention method. (6) MInference: The SOTA method for long-context prefilling acceleration, utilizing three sparse patterns including block-level sparse attention. It's worth noting that since MInference doesn't support length extrapolation, we use an alternative evaluation method, applying it to Llama-3-8B-Instruct-262k (Llama3 after long-text post-training). Additionally, we do not include another SOTA method, QUEST [16], as it does not support Grouped Query Attention (GQA).\nImplementation details. In all experiments in this paper, we employ greedy decoding to ensure the reliability of the results. For our TokenSelect, we implement it on SGLang [18], which is a fast serving framework based on Flasherinfer [24]. We implement our method using PyTorch [65] and Triton [19]. We follow the baseline"}, {"title": "6.2 Performance Comparisons", "content": "InfiniteBench. As shown in Table 1, our TokenSelect achieves significantly superior overall performance on InfiniteBench compared to all baseline methods, even though TokenSelect uses the smallest token budget (<3K). The fact that it significantly outperforms the original models demonstrates TokenSelect's strong length extrapolation capability. We analyze that this is due to our adoption of a fine-grained KV Cache selection strategy, while considering the equal contribution of each head to selection, which ensures that we can select most critical tokens. Observing the performance of other methods, we find that ROPE interpolation methods (NTK, Self-Extend) generally perform poorly unless used on specially trained models such as Qwen2-7B-Instruct. The better performance of Qwen2-7B-Instruct on the original model can also be attributed to this. The sparse attention method StreamingLLM, based on fixed sparse patterns, can guarantee some of the model's capabilities, but due to discarding a large amount of long-context information, it performs poorly on retrieval-related tasks (R.PK, R.Num, R.KV). The block-level selection method InfLLM can retain more long-context information compared to StreamingLLM. However, due to its sub-optimal block-level selection, it results in lower performance on most tasks compared to TokenSelect, even though we set a larger token budget for InfLLM. It is worth noting that Yi-1.5-6B does not perform normally on the R.KV task, as it is unable to correctly recite strings like the Universally Unique Identifier.\nRULER. To further demonstrate the long-context capability of TokenSelect, we conduct evaluation on the more challenging long-context benchmark RULER. Considering the increased difficulty of RULER and its substantial computational requirements, we include only comparable baseline methods. As shown in Table 2, our TokenSelect maintains significantly superior overall performance compared to other long-context inference methods.

First, we observe that even selecting a very small number of tokens (e.g., 128, 256), our TokenSelect still demonstrates very comparable performance. Then, as k increases, the effectiveness of TokenSelect further improves, indicating that more moderately critical tokens also contribute to the retention of long-context information. Finally, we find that when k is set to larger values (e.g., 16K), our TokenSelect shows significant improvements in most tasks, further advancing the performance landscape of long-context inference methods.\nSimilarity threshold of the Selection Cache \u03b8. Fig. 6 shows that the Selection Cache hit rate increases significantly as the similarity threshold e decreases, converging around \u03b8 = 0.5. This suggests potential for further acceleration of TokenSelect's Decode Stage by reducing \u03b8. Performance sensitivity to \u03b8 varies across tasks. While most tasks exhibit slight performance degradation with decreasing \u03b8, and R.PK in InfiniteBench shows no degradation, more challenging retrieval tasks like R.KV demonstrate significant performance deterioration. This indicates higher dynamicity requirements for token selection in these tasks."}, {"title": "6.5 Efficiency Comparisons", "content": "Efficiency of selective sparse attention.

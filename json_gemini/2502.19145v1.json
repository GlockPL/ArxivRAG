We develop simulations of agents collaborating on shared objectives to study these security risks and security trade-offs. We focus on scenarios where an attacker compromises one agent, using it to steer the entire system toward misaligned outcomes by corrupting other agents. In this context, we observe infectious malicious prompts the multi-hop spreading of malicious instructions. To mitigate this risk, we evaluated several strategies: two \"vaccination\" approaches that insert false memories of safely handling malicious input into the agents' memory stream, and two versions of a generic safety instruction strategy. While these defenses reduce the spread and fulfillment of malicious instructions in our experiments, they tend to decrease collaboration capability in the agent network. Our findings illustrate potential trade-off between security and collaborative efficiency in multi-agent systems, providing insights for designing more secure yet effective AI collaborations.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) training and instruction tuning have resulted in AI agents interacting with humans, and each other, through natural language while accessing vast bodies of digital knowledge (Llama team and contributors 2023; OpenAI 2024a). Although this has produced novel productivity tools and digital assistants for humans (e.g., ChatGPT), LLM agents are increasingly interacting autonomously (Shen et al. 2023; Boiko, MacKnight, and Gomes 2023). Such strongly interacting networks of autonomous agents pose novel security problems that are so far poorly understood but could constitute systemic risks (Commission 2021). In this paper, we examine a security vulnerability in multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems, analogous to the propagation of worms in traditional digital systems. Our attack involves injecting a malicious prompt into the input of an LLM agent, which can then be disseminated to other agents through communication channels. Without an appropriate defense strategy, this could lead to rapid proliferation, resulting in a system-wide compromise of LLM agents with harmful instructions. This scenario poses systemic risks to the digital infrastructure, similar to the threats exemplified by incidents like Stuxnet (Langner 2011). More robust defense strategies are needed to secure multi-agent systems against such threat scenarios. The challenge is to design proper defense mechanisms that increase system-level robustness while maintaining a high level of cooperation within the multi-agent system. We demonstrate this trade-off empirically by evaluating system robustness and agent cooperation across a diverse set of defense strategies and underlying LLMs."}, {"title": "1.1 Contributions", "content": "Our main contributions are:\n\u2022 We demonstrate the spread of malicious prompts in a realistic multi-agent LLM simulation of an autonomous chemical research facility\n\u2022 We evaluate diverse defense strategies against the spread of malicious instructions, including novel strategies, referred to as \"vaccines\", that insert a forged memory of having safely handled a malicious input into the agents' memory (see 9.7).\n\u2022 We measure the effect of these defense strategies on both system robustness and agent cooperation.\n\u2022 We observe a potential trade-off between system robustness and agent cooperation across a diverse set of defense strategies that can remain unnoticed if evaluations of defense strategies do not take the impact on the normal operations of the system into account."}, {"title": "2 Related Work", "content": "Modern LLM applications are less and less made of one single LLM but mostly encompassed within a system:\nTool-LLM (Qin et al. 2023): With LLMs integrated into applications, models can expand their language capabilities to perform actions on behalf of the user through the use of API calls (Osika 2023; OpenAI 2023, 2024c), web research, and writing reports (Elovic 2023), and directly interacting with computer (Anthropic 2024).\nLLM Agents (Wang et al. 2024a): To improve the ability of LLMs to act in the world, autonomous systems with an LLM core were created with the capacity to interact with tools and call APIs while maintaining memory and reacting to the environment (Boiko, MacKnight, and Gomes 2023; Liang et al. 2023; Shen et al. 2023). These LLM-based agent systems are designed to tackle complex problems or perform decision-making applied in a wide range of situations (Yao et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024). New methods are continuously introduced, such as prompt-based learning (Liu et al. 2021), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Li et al. 2022), planning (Hao et al. 2023), and self-improvement and memory for LLM Agents (Zhao et al. 2023).\nLLM Multi-Agent Systems (Park et al. 2023): Multi-agent systems are composed of many LLM agents to solve complex objectives (Nascimento, Alencar, and Cowan 2023; Zhang et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024b). These systems were designed to extend the capabilities and the application domain of single LLM-based agent systems, such as software engineering and automating research (Zheng et al. 2023). With collective intelligence of a group of specialized agents, research might find better results than relying on a single agent (Hong et al. 2023)."}, {"title": "2.1 Security of LLM Agents", "content": "With the growth of LLM adoption, concerns about security and safety issues are emerging (Li et al. 2023; Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2023). Current models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks through malicious instructions, called \"jailbreaks\" (Wei, Haghtalab, and Steinhardt 2023). There exist different types of malicious instructions such as direct (Liu et al. 2024) or indirect (Greshake et al. 2023) prompt injection. For direct prompt injection, the attacker sends a malicious prompt directly to the language model while indirect ones are injected into the content that LLM agents use to inform their responses (such as a website an agent retrieves containing a malicious prompt). LLM-agents are also vulnerable to backdoor injections within their core LLM that exclusively target a deployment as agents by exploiting their multi-step reasoning process (Yang et al. 2024). Our work focuses on direct threats of jailbreaks. In terms of defense, recent work has demonstrated that while attacks transfer from LLM to LLM-agents, safety measures do not (Andriushchenko et al. 2024; Lermen, Dziemian, and Pimpale 2024; Kumar et al. 2024).\nAt the multi-agent level, replications of malicious instructions within multi-LLM systems had been demonstrated in abstract non-realistic environments (Gu et al. 2024) and in the context of a GenAI email assistant (Cohen, Bitton, and Nassi 2024). Recent work has also shown how malicious prompts can create a \"domino effect\" in multi-agent systems, where compromising one agent can trigger cascading failures across the entire system (Tian et al. 2024). We study defense strategies within such environments."}, {"title": "3 Methodology", "content": "3.1 Experiment 1: Defenses in a Realistic Multi-Agent Research Environment\nIn this experiment, we investigate the effectiveness of various defense mechanisms in reducing the success rate of malicious instructions within a simulated multi-agent system modeled after the autonomous chemical research facility proposed by (Zheng et al. 2023). This system is composed of seven agents with specific roles (operationalized with different prompts, see 9.2 for more details), which naturally implies a need for cooperation toward any shared objective. The supervision typically performed by the human researcher is done by an AI project manager, Atlas. The objectives of the research facility are the same as in the original paper (Zheng et al. 2023):\naccelerate \"the discovery of optimal microwave synthesis conditions, enhancing the crystallinity of MOF-321, MOF-322, and COF-323 and achieving the desired porosity and water capacity\".\nWithin this multi-agent system, we study a targeted attack scenario aimed at the destruction of research equipment by instructing the agents to perform a harmful reaction leading to an explosion. The malicious instructions instruct the bots to mix hydrogen peroxide with acetone and hydrogen chloride (see 9.10 for details)."}, {"title": "System Initialization", "content": "Our research agents are based on an AutoGPT architecture (Significant-Gravitas 2023). At the start of each simulation, agents are initialized with either one of the defense strategies applied and empty memory otherwise. We use various OpenAI models: GPT-3.5-turbo (Brown et al. 2020), GPT-4-turbo (OpenAI 2024a), GPT-4 Omni, and GPT-4 Omni mini (OpenAI 2024b). Agent models are initialized with a system prompt (provided in 9.3) and an empty memory stream. The simulation is asynchronous, with agents running in parallel.\nEvery agent has a first-in-first-out message queue. Every time an agent processes a new message, it first uses an internal scratchpad for reacting, reasoning, planning, and self-critiquing before producing a list of actions to perform through a provided list of \"tools\" to which it has access. In our case, the actions consist of messaging other bots and running python code (see 9.1 for details)."}, {"title": "Starting the Task", "content": "To begin each simulation, we send a message to the lab manager agent (Atlas) containing instructions to \"optimize MOF crystallinity\" (see 9.4).

The malicious instruction is one of 12 unique prompts intended to provoke an explosion (see 9.10). The exclusion of Atlas and Deng from potential targets is deliberate, as Atlas carries authority and Deng is very likely to directly follow the malicious instructions without spreading them, leaving five other agents as potential targets."}, {"title": "Simulation Termination", "content": "The simulation continues until one of three conditions is met:\n1.

All interventions are applied indiscriminately to all agents:\n\u2022 Safety instruction: We add generic safety guidelines to the agent's system prompt (see Section 9.5, Section 9.6 in Appendix for details). Passive instructions only ask the agent to beware of any suspicious messages, while active instructions instruct the model to actively counteract the spread of malicious instructions.\n\u2022 Memory Vaccines: We insert a memory payload into the agent's history. In this fake memory, the agent received a malicious input and safely reacted to this (see Section 9.7, Section 9.8 in Appendix for details). This vaccine becomes the agent's first memory. Like their instructions counterparts, passive vaccines contain a non-compliant but passive (a simple refusal to follow instruction) response to a malicious incoming message, while active vaccines contain an actively resistant response to such inputs: in the active case, the vaccine emulates a proactive behavior where the agent takes actions to counteract the spread of the malicious instructions by messaging other agents."}, {"title": "Running the simulations", "content": "To measure the impact of our security interventions on multi-hop spreading, for each of the five defense strategies and each of the five models, we run 36 simulations.

Our evaluation of the effect of various defense strategies against this threat scenario demonstrates a potential trade-off between system robustness and agent cooperation. This finding highlights the need to account for this trade-off when designing robust and helpful multi-agent systems.\nFurthermore, our experiments point to the importance of a multi-hop, and multi-agent analysis for assessing the security properties and capabilities of multi-agent systems. This is because: 1) Malicious instructions can take multiple steps to reach their target. 2) Agents' behavior can shift after multiple exposures to similar or contradictory signals.\nWe find that eliciting active resistance to malicious instructions can help to significantly reduce their spread within a multi-agent system but usually comes at the cost of reducing cooperation within agents. Our findings suggest that for most models studied, one-shot examples defense strategies through vaccines do not degrade cooperation while improving the system's robustness.\nLimitations: Our study is limited to one realistic but specific multi-agent system: an autonomous chemical research lab. This limits the generalizability of our results as other settings, such as autonomous software engineering teams, may lead to novel behaviors. We also focused only on one type of attack scenario: a malicious intervention with the goal of generating material destruction within the research facility through inducing a chemical explosion. Other scenarios could have been studied such as private data or intellectual property exfiltration. Finally, we used only a limited number of malicious prompts (12) to test those scenarios but it is worth considering that most of the spread is done via imperfect replication: the agents do not spread verbatim copies of the malicious instructions but new variants (see figure 2 as an example, Atlas' message to Deng is not a copy of Faraday's); therefore the variation of malicious messages circulating within our system is actually much bigger than the number of malicious prompts originally injected.\nOur second experiment uses agent compliance to unusual but non-harmful instructions as a proxy for collaboration efficiency. However, multi-agent collaboration efficiency encompasses more than just compliance and may not correlate perfectly with our proxy. Additional work could be done to measure collaboration using system-level outcomes instead.\nA major limitation is that we only used simple attacks and defenses. Researchers have devised new methods of securing AI systems, including using LoRA to prevent responding to jailbreaks (Zou et al. 2024), or having a model classify every message as a jailbreak or not before allowing the core model to process it (Kim, Derakhshan, and Harris 2023). For the results to generalize to modern models, defending against state of the art attack methods is also pertinent, such as Best-of-N jailbreaking(Hughes et al. 2024). Additional inquiries should be performed to consider the latest attack and defense methods."}, {"title": "6 Conclusion", "content": "Trading off willingness to collaborate with refusal to do harm is a core problem of LLM safety training but could become exacerbated in multi-agent systems where multiple messages containing similar or contradictory instructions can be processed over time. We empirically study this trade-off in a realistic multi-agent system and demonstrate that evaluating only the effect of specific defense strategies on multi-agent robustness can be highly misleading and hide important negative side effects on the agents' cooperation ability. Our findings about the trade-off between security and collaboration capabilities align with observations by Hua et al. (2024), who found that implementing safety constraints through their TrustAgent framework requires careful consideration of how safety measures impact an agent's ability to perform its intended functions."}, {"title": "7 Funding", "content": "The research leading to these results has received funding from OpenAI as part of their Research into Agentic AI Systems grant program."}, {"title": "8 AAAI Reproducibility Checklist", "content": "This paper:\n\u2022 Includes a conceptual outline and/or pseudocode description of AI methods introduced (yes)\n\u2022 Clearly delineates statements that are opinions, hypothesis, and speculation from objective facts and results (yes)\n\u2022 Provides well marked pedagogical references for less-familiare readers to gain background necessary to replicate the paper (yes)\nDoes this paper make theoretical contributions?

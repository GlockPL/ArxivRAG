Although current models perform well, their effectiveness diminishes when confronted with the diverse and evolving nature of real-world deepfakes. To address this issue, we propose a continual learning method named Region-Based Optimization (RegO) for audio deepfake detection. Specifically, we use the Fisher information matrix to measure important neuron regions for real and fake audio detection, dividing them into four regions. First, we directly fine-tune the less important regions to quickly adapt to new tasks. Next, we apply gradient optimization in parallel for regions important only to real audio detection, and in orthogonal directions for regions important only to fake audio detection. For regions that are important to both, we use sample proportion-based adaptive gradient optimization. This region-adaptive optimization ensures an appropriate trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Additionally, to address the increase of redundant neurons from old tasks, we further introduce the Ebbinghaus forgetting mechanism to release them, thereby promoting the model's ability to learn more generalized discriminative features. Experimental results show our method achieves a 21.3% improvement in EER over the state-of-the-art continual learning approach RWM for audio deepfake detection. Moreover, the effectiveness of RegO extends beyond the audio deepfake detection domain, showing potential significance in other tasks, such as image recognition.

Consequently, researchers are increasingly focusing on audio deepfake detection mechanisms (Yi et al. 2023b). Community-led initiatives, such as the ASVspoof Challenges (Kinnunen et al. 2017; Todisco et al. 2019; Yamagishi et al. 2021) and the Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) Challenges (Yi et al. 2022, 2023a), significantly advance the field of fake audio detection. In addition, the introduction of pre-trained audio models significantly improves the effectiveness of audio deepfake detection, achieving impressive performance on publicly available datasets. (Tak et al. 2022; Wang and Yamagishi 2022; Hsu et al. 2021)\nDespite the significant advancements in audio deepfake detection models, their performance is still limited when confronted with diverse and unseen forged audio in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, two primary approaches have been developed. The first approach utilizes data augmentation and multi-feature fusion techniques to extract robust audio features, improving the generalization of model across various datasets (Wang et al. 2023; Fan et al. 2024). The second approach is based on continual learning (Ma et al. 2021), where the model incrementally learns from both new and old datasets, allowing it to integrate previously learned discriminative information. This enhances its detection capability for diverse and unseen deepfakes, achieving a balance between memory stability (the model's ability to retain performance on old tasks) and learning plasticity (the model's ability to perform on new tasks). Currently, the most advanced continual learning methods for audio deepfake detection, Regularized Adaptive Weight Modification (RAWM) (Zhang et al. 2023) and Radian Weight Modification (RWM) (Zhang et al. 2024), overcome catastrophic forgetting by introducing trainable gradient correction directions to optimize weights. While RAWM and RWM exhibit notable effectiveness in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, the use of Recursive Least Squares (RLS) (Shah, Palmieri, and Datum 1992) to approximate the gradient plane of previous tasks can introduce errors (Liavas and Regalia 1999). Moreover, applying gradient modification to all neurons restricts the model's learning plasticity for new tasks.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we propose a continual learning method for audio deepfake detection, named Region-Based Optimization (RegO). Under the same acoustic environments, real audio exhibits a more compact feature distribution compared to fake audio (Ma et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2023, 2024), so they can be seen as a whole from the same dataset. Based on this observation, we propose that for new tasks, gradient updates for real audio should be parallel to the gradient directions of previous tasks, while the updates for fake audio should be orthogonal to the previous task gradients. Specifically, we utilize the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to measure the importance of neurons in the model, and then calculate the FIM for both real and fake audio detection separately. Following the fundamental principle of not constraining unimportant neurons to allow the model to quickly adapt to new tasks, and optimizing important neurons to overcome catastrophic forgetting, we divide the neurons into four regions for fine-grained region-adaptive gradient optimization: neurons that are unimportant for both real and fake audio detection are finetune directly to quickly adapt to new tasks; neurons that are important only for real audio detection are updated in parallel to the previous task gradients; neurons important only for fake audio detection are updated orthogonally to the previous task gradients; and neurons important for both real and fake audio detection are optimized through adaptive gradient updates based on the ratio of real to fake samples to maintain memory stability.\nHowever, when the number of neurons in the model remains fixed as tasks increase, two problems arise: First, the number of neurons in less important regions decreases, making it progressively harder for the model to adapt to new tasks. Second, redundant neurons appear those that are beneficial for only a few specific tasks but ineffective for others. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from the non-linear nature of human memory forgetting (Loftus 1985; Ebbinghaus 2013). Over time, the memories that persist are generally those involving deeply understood knowledge, while other redundant Knowledge are forgotten. Based on this principle, we further propose a neuron forgetting mechanism inspired by the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve (Wo\u017aniak, Gorzela\u0144czyk, and Murakowski 1995) to release redundant neurons from previous tasks. This mechanism enables the model to learn knowledge from new tasks more efficiently, ensuring quicker adaptation to new tasks and the acquisition of more generalized discriminative information.\nOur experiments on the Evolving Deepfake Audio (EVDA) benchmark (Zhang, Yi, and Tao 2024) demonstrate that our method outperforms several mainstream continual learning methods and state-of-the-art continual audio deepfake detection methods, including RAWM and RWM, in terms of balancing stability and plasticity. Furthermore, our method can be easily extended to other domains. General study conducted on image recognition tasks also showed competitive results, highlighting the potential significance of our approach across different machine learning fields.\nIn summary, we make the following contributions:\n\u2022 We propose a continual learning method for audio deep-fake detection, named RegO, which partitions the neural network parameter space into four regions using the FIM. This method facilitates fine-grained, region-adaptive gradient optimization, ensuring an optimal trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity.\n\u2022 We further propose a neuron forgetting mechanism based on Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, which releases redundant neurons from previous tasks to ensure faster adaptation to new tasks and to learn more generalizable discriminative information.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on the EVDA benchmark to validate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we perform general study, and the results indicate that our approach holds potential significance in other domains, such as image recognition, without being limited to a specific field."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "Continual learning is a machine learning paradigm that aims to enable models to retain and use previously learned knowledge while continuously learning new tasks, thereby overcoming catastrophic forgetting. Current mainstream methods can be categorized into the following types: Regularization-based methods, which balance new and old tasks by selectively adding regularization terms to the changes in network parameters, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) (Kirkpatrick et al. 2017), Synaptic Intelligence (SI) (Zenke, Poole, and Ganguli 2017), Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) (Lopez-Paz and Ranzato 2017), Orthogonal Weight Modification (OWM) (Zeng et al. 2019) etc. (Qiao et al. 2024; Elsayed and Mahmood 2023) Replay-based methods, which carefully select training samples from previous tasks, store them in a buffer, and mix them with new task training samples to ensure accuracy for old tasks, such as Greedy Sampler and Dumb Learner (GDumb) (Prabhu, Torr, and Dokania 2020) and CWRStar (Lomonaco et al. 2020); Architecture-based methods, which use parameter isolation and dynamic expansion of the parameter space to protect previously acquired knowledge. (Wang et al. 2022; Razdaibiedina et al. 2023)\nMainstream continual learning methods have achieved significant success in various fields, including image classification (Razdaibiedina et al. 2023; Yoo et al. 2024), object detection (Menezes et al. 2023), and semantic segmentation (Camuffo and Milani 2023; Zhu et al. 2023). Continual learning methods are also effective in audio deepfake detection, empowering models to recognize diverse and unseen fake audio by leveraging continual learning principles. Currently, most continual learning methods for audio deepfake detection are regularization-based, such as Detecting Fake Without Forgetting (DFWF) (Ma et al. 2021), RAWM (Zhang et al. 2023), and RWM (Zhang et al. 2024), and have demonstrated impressive results. However, the approximations made by regularization methods can lead to cumulative errors during continual learning, affecting the balance between model stability and plasticity. In contrast, our method selectively adjusts the gradients of parameters that are crucial for previous tasks while fine-tuning the remaining parameters to learn new tasks. This allows our method to adapt more quickly to new tasks while preventing catastrophic forgetting of old ones."}, {"title": "Methodology", "content": "In this section, the Region-Based Optimization (RegO) architecture, as illustrated in Figure 1, encompasses the principles and implementation of three core modules: Importance Region Localization (IRL), Region-Adaptive Optimization (RAO), and the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Mechanism (EFM)."}, {"title": "Definitions and Notation", "content": "In Continual Learning, we define a sequence of tasks {T1, T2, T3, ..., TN } of N tasks.

During the training of task k, we define the loss function as follows:\n$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta_k, D_k) = \\frac{1}{|D_k|}\\sum_{(x,y) \\in D_k} CE(f(x;\\theta_k), Y)$ (1)\nwhere CE is the standard cross-entropy loss. The gradient is shown as follows:\ngk = \u22070kL(0k, Dk) (2)"}, {"title": "Importance Region Localization", "content": "First, we need to identify the neuron regions that are important for the previous tasks. Inspired by (Kirkpatrick et al. 2017; Husz\u00e1r 2018), we choose the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a measure of neuron importance. After completing the training of the k-th task, we pass real and fake audio through the model separately to calculate the corresponding FIM, which encapsulate the importance measures of the weights for both real and fake audio detection. The FIM is defined as follows:\n$F_k^{(c)}(\\theta) = E [\\nabla_{\\theta}log \\ p(D^{(c)}|\\theta) \\nabla_{\\theta}log \\ p(D^{(c)}|\\theta)^T]$ (3)\nHere, c is 0 (fake) or 1 (real), Dk represents the training dataset corresponding to Tk, and 0 denotes the optimal parameters for Tk. Note that the log probability of the data D(c) given the parameters log p(D|0) is simply the negative of the loss function \u2013L(0k, Dk) for task Tk. Based on this, by setting the threshold \u03b1, we locate important neurons, resulting in a localization matrix, as shown in Equation 4.\n$\\begin{equation*}\nL_k[i][j] = \\begin{cases}\n2 & \\text{if } c = 0 \\text{ and } F_k^{(c)}[i][j] \\geq P_{\\alpha}(F_k^{(c)})\n\\\\ 1 & \\text{if } c = 1 \\text{ and } F_k^{(c)}[i][j] \\geq P_{\\alpha}(F_k^{(c)})\n\\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4}\n\\end{equation*}$ \nwhere i, j represents the neuron index, P\u03b1 represents the \u03b1-percentile. Based on this, by summing the localization matrices for both real and fake audio, we can identify four distinct regions, as shown in Equation 5.\nRk[i][j] = L[i][j] + L[i][j] (5)\nIn the Rk, regions with values 0, 1, 2, and 3 are denoted by the letters A, B, C, and D, respectively. Region A represents neurons that are not important for Tk. Region B represents neurons that are important for real audio detection in Tk. Region C represents neurons that are important for fake audio detection in Tk. Region D represents neurons that are important for both real and fake audio detection in Tk."}, {"title": "Region-Adaptive Optimization", "content": "During training, starting from the second task, we merge all region matrices R from the previous tasks to obtain R. For the four regions A, B, C, and D within R, we adaptively optimize each region according to the following principles.\nFirstly, because the neurons in region A have minimal impact on previous tasks, but are likely to become important for new tasks, we allow them to quickly adapt and learn the knowledge of the new tasks. Therefore, we do not apply additional gradient optimization to the neurons in region A and instead update them using fine-tuning, the gradient of region A is defined in Equation 6.\n9A = 9\u00a9 I{R[i][j]=0} (6)\nwhere \u00a9 denote the Hadamard product, {R[i][j]=0} is an indicator function that takes a value of 1 when R[i][j] equals 0 and 0 otherwise.\nSecond, as mentioned above, real audio has a more compact feature distribution compared to fake audio and can be considered as coming from the same dataset. Therefore, to largely retain the knowledge of real audio detection from previous tasks, the neurons in region B should project the current gradient g onto the direction of the old task gradient \u011d for gradient optimization, as shown in Equation 7.\n$\\hat{g} = \\frac{g \\cdot \\hat{g}}{\\|\\hat{g}\\|^2} \\hat{g}$ \ngB = \u011d \u00a9 I{R[i][j]=1} (7)\nThirdly, due to the diversity of speech synthesis and voice conversion methods, there is a wide variance in feature distributions among fake audio samples. Therefore, to reduce the forgetting of discriminative information about fake audio from previous tasks while learning discriminative information for fake audio in new tasks, we update the gradient direction of neurons in region C to be orthogonal to the gradient direction of the old tasks, as shown in Equation 8.\ngo = g \u2212 \u011d\n9C = go \u00a9 I{R[i][j]=2} (8)\nFourth, region D is crucial for both real and fake audio discrimination from previous tasks. Therefore, to balance the retention of knowledge for both real and fake audio detection in neurons of region D, we need to optimize the gradient update direction to achieve an optimal trade-off. Specifically, we adaptively determine whether the gradient update direction should lean more towards the projection direction or the orthogonal direction based on the proportion of real and fake audio samples, as shown in Equations 9 and 10.\n$\\beta = \\frac{\\sum_{l=1}^{u} N^l}{\\sum_{l=1}^{u+v} N^l}$ (9)\n$\\tilde{g} = \\beta * g_p + (1 - \\beta) * g_o$\nJD = 9 \u00a9 I{R[i][j]=3} (10)\nIn Equation 9, u and v represent the number of classes with similar feature distributions and the remaining classes, respectively. In deepfake audio detection, u and v are both set to 1, indicating the two classes of real and fake audio. In image recognition, u and v represent the number of classes with similar feature distributions and the number of classes with dissimilar feature distributions, respectively. N\u00b9 denotes the number of samples in the batch for the l-th class. Finally, the total gradient update for a batch is defined as:\nw = 9A+9B+9C + 9D (11)"}, {"title": "Ebbinghaus Forgetting Mechanism", "content": "During the continual learning process, when the number of neurons remains constant, neurons in region A gradually diminish, and redundant neurons that only benefit individual tasks begin to emerge, which undermines the model's adaptability and generalization ability. To address this issue, inspired by Ebbinghaus forgetting theory (Loftus 1985; Ebbinghaus 2013), we propose a neuron forgetting mechanism based on the Ebbinghaus memory curve (Wo\u017aniak, Gorzela\u0144czyk, and Murakowski 1995).

Specifically, we define the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve function based on the number of tasks processed so far, and calculate the memory weights using this forgetting curve function. Then, we allocate memory weights to the region matrix R of the old tasks. By Equation 13 and 14, we compute the memory matrix M, which contains the accumulated memory weights for each neuron. Finally, we set a threshold \u03b3. When the memory weight of a neuron is less than \u03b3, that neuron is released, resulting in the Ebbinghaus matrix E.\nMk[i][j] = $\\sum_{t=1}^{k-1}$ \u03c6(t) *I{Rt[i][j]={0,1,2,3}} (13)\n$\\begin{equation*}\nE_k [i][j] = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } M_k[i][j] > \\gamma\n\\\\ 0 & \\text{if } M_k[i][j] < \\gamma\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{14}\n\\end{equation*}$"}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

The EVDA baseline dataset configuration includes cross-lingual (Chinese and English) and cross-task (whole-segment and partial-segment fake detection) scenarios to simulate the unseen and diverse real-world forgery conditions. The final model in this study refers to the model trained sequentially on these eight datasets and evaluated on each dataset. We use the standard metric Equal Error Rate (EER) (Wu et al. 2017) in the field of audio deepfake detection to evaluate the performance of our model.\nModel We employ the pre-trained speech model Wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al. 2020) as the feature extractor, the parameters of Wav2vec 2.0 are loaded from the pretrained model XLSR-53 (Conneau et al. 2021).

The results for \"w/o RAO\" suggest that, compared to orthogonally optimizing all weights, applying region-adaptive gradient optimization to critical regions alone achieves a better balance between model memory stability and learning plasticity. Additionally, we observe that \"w/o EFM\" performs better than RegO on some of the earlier datasets, but its overall capability is inferior to RegO. We attribute this to the significant differences among the eight audio deepfake detection datasets, which result in a substantial number of redundant neurons.

The experimental results show that our method performs best when \u03b1 is set to 0.75. As \u03b1 increases, the region of important neurons (i.e., regions B, C, and D) shrinks, reducing model stability. Conversely, as \u03b1 decreases, the region of less important neurons (i.e., region A) diminishes, leading to reduced model plasticity. Both scenarios result in a decline in model performance.

We speculate that this is because the CLEAR benchmark represents a decade-long natural temporal evolution of real-world visual concepts, where the appearance of major categories such as computers, cameras, etc. has remained relatively unchanged over the years. The results of Finetune-Exp\u2081 support this hypothesis: after training on Exp1, the accuracy remains similar from Exp\u2081 to Exp5 but shows a slight decline from Exp5 to Exp10. This indicates that retaining old knowledge might interfere with performance across multiple tasks. On the other hand, in the audio deepfake detection task, where differences in synthesis or conversion algorithms are more distinct (as shown by the Finetune-Exp\u2081 results in Table 1), the role of EFM becomes more critical.

Varde", "Weitian Wang"], "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, integration of commonsense knowledge (CSK) in AI systems is becoming highly crucial to enhance the decision-making capabilities of robots, especially in next-generation multipurpose environments. This paper presents Robo-CSK-Organizer, a pioneering system that employs CSK, via a classical knowledge base, to facilitate sophisticated task-based object organization helpful in multipurpose robots. Unlike systems relying solely on deep learning tools such as ChatGPT, our Robo-CSK-Organizer system stands out in various crucial aspects. This includes: (1) its ability to resolve ambiguities and maintain consistency in object placement; (2) its adaptability to diverse task-based classifications; and moreover, (3) its contributions to explainable AI (XAI), consequently helping to foster trust and human-robot collaboration. This system's efficacy is underlined by DETIC (DEtector with Image Classes), an advanced extension of Detectron2 for object identification; BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) for context discernment; and most vitally by the adaptation of ConceptNet, a well-grounded commonsense knowledge base for reasoning based on semantic as well as pragmatic knowledge. While we deploy ConceptNet to extract CSK, the process in Robo-CSK-Organizer is generic enough to be replicated with other state-of-the-art knowledge bases. Controlled experiments and real-world applications, synopsized in this paper, make Robo-CSK-Organizer demonstrate superior performance in placing objects in contextually relevant locations, highlighting its clear capacity for commonsense-guided decision-making closer to the thresholds of human cognition. Hence, Robo-CSK-Organizer makes valuable contributions to Robotics and AI.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction to Robo-CSK-Organizer", "content": "The expanding role of multipurpose robots necessitates the development of transparent, intelligent systems capable of handling complex, context-driven operations. Traditional robotic arms, while proficient in assembly tasks, often struggle with nuanced decision-making in dynamic environments. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing Robo-CSK-Organizer (see Fig. 1), a system that demonstrates Explainable AI (XAI) via Commonsense Knowledge (CSK) to enhance the decision-making capabilities of robots. Imbibing CSK through the ConceptNet knowledge base, this system aims to address the opaque-box issue in AI (typically found in pure deep learning systems), characterized by a lack of decision-making clarity a growing concern in the realm of robotics where precision and trust are paramount [32].\nThe Robo-CSK-Organizer system is proposed to address the limitations of current AI systems, which often fall short in tasks requiring deep contextual awareness. Traditional AI models may often struggle with differentiating between similar objects in varied contexts, such as distinguishing a child's toy from a pet's toy, or understanding the appropriate placement of objects in household settings. Robo-CSK-Organizer bridges this gap by adequately deploying commonsense knowledge (CSK) to enhance the organization of detected objects for task classification in multiple avenues.\nNote that CSK differs from encyclopedic knowledge [20], [16] (where AI systems far surpass humans). \"Common sense\" is naturally found in humans who acquire it inherently at birth, enhance it with further growth, and use it for intuitive reasoning. Machines on the other hand are not endowed with CSK by default and hence can often find it challenging to conduct reasoning intuitively unless pre-programmed with rigorous training [9]. For instance, it is very easy and in fact rather obvious for a human to know that the \"door\" of a refrigerator should not remain open (except while placing things in it or taking them out) [4]. Conversely, the \u201cdoor\u201d of an office can certainly be open and is often ajar - a related fact also quite obvious to humans. Such knowledge is very subtle and is thus considered really simplistic or too common! Yet it can often be crucial in decision-making. Therefore, the role of CSK can be vital in modern-day AI systems as noticed significantly in the literature [33], [1].\nRobo-CSK-Organizer precisely addresses this concept of CSK in AI. More specifically, it employs a robust semantic network from a classical knowledge base, namely ConceptNet [26], hence enabling robots to make more well-informed"}, {"title": "2 The Robo-CSK-Organizer Approach", "content": "The system diagram of Robo-CSK-Detector, illustrative of its functioning approach, appears in Fig. 2 Its salient features are as described below.\n1.  Resolving ambiguity in object categorization: Classification of objects, such as deciding whether a pear belongs in the kitchen or the garden, highlights the ambiguity inherent in object categorization today. This issue extends to the difficulty of providing comprehensive labeled training examples for every possible object arrangement and is effectively achieved by Robo-CSK-Organizer by harnessing CSK in a task-relevant manner.\n2.  Maintaining consistency in object placement: Ensuring consistency in placing objects is crucial, particularly to build trust among users (e.g. helpful in human-robot collaboration) as well as among other robots in a multi-robot environment. Robots must reason with basic commonsense as well as domain knowledge and manage contextual variations to in order to ensure reliable object placement. This is well-achieved by Robo-CSK-Organizer with clear reasoning paths.\n3.  Depicting task relevance and adaptability: Robots demonstrating adaptability in prioritizing tasks based on context, e.g. choosing between gardening and culinary activities, is vital. This is especially with respect to probabilistic uncertainties in sensing and navigation. Robo-CSK-Organizer handles this very well due to its systematic approach guided by a well-grounded knowledge base.\n4.  Fostering explainability in Al systems: A critical aspect of XAI (Explainable AI) is ensuring that AI systems are not just intelligent but also comprehensible and interpretable. Robo-CSK-Organizer excels in explainability, surpassing other systems (e.g. ChatGPT-based organizers) by adequately harnessing CSK due to which decision-making processes are more transparent and understandable."}, {"title": "3 System Demo and Evaluation", "content": "In order to demonstrate the efficacy of Robo-CSK-Organizer, it is compared with a baseline task organizer that uses the well-known ChatGPT for guidance. We thus present the following.\nObject Detection: Both the systems, our Robo-CSK-Organizer and the ChatGPT baseline, use DETIC (\"DEtector with Image) ensure a broad evaluation spectrum. Specific context groups, particularly domestic locations (e.g. kitchen, garden, pantry, dining room) are chosen for evaluation. These contexts are relevant to the selected object categories and provided with a controlled environment for testing. An advanced extension of Detectron2 for object detection, which contains over 21,000 classes [31] [35] is used here to provide choices of classes for object organization. Each object is queried against each system (Robo-CSK-Organizer / ChatGPT) 10 times, asking it to organize the object into one of the provided contexts. Responses from both systems are recorded for each iteration, and the most frequent context is identified as the predominant choice for object placement,\nContext Recognition: BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) is employed to identify contexts such as the kitchen or office, and thus generate room captions for enhanced clarity [19]. Note that the usage of such software can be helpful in a variety of applications, e.g. image personalization via text by harnessing diffusion models [14]. The hardware foundation for both systems (i.e. Robo-CSK-Organizer and the ChatGPT baseline) includes a Franka Emika robotic arm [12] with an Intel Realsense D435i camera [15], integrated with ROS. Robo-CSK-Organizer works with this hardware, and incorporates CSK-based reasoning (See Algorithm 1). This is the key to addressing the opaque-box issue in AI, aiming for clearer and more transparent object sorting.\nNote that the pivotal distinction between the 2 systems lies in the functioning approach for sorting objects into relevant contexts. While ChatGPT relies solely on prior training with deep learning, Robo-CSK-Organizer applies commonsense knowledge due to which it can be more adept in successfully handling first-time scenarios as well. More details appear next.\nRobo-CSK-organizer: It harnesses a classical knowledge base called ConceptNet [26] for semantic insights and commonsense reasoning. It infers object locations using metrics known as edge weight and degree of separation, prioritizing paths based on these factors. While ConceptNet is chosen for its user-friendly interface and clear path logic, we claim that other relevant CSK knowledge bases can also be used.\nChatGPT baseline: A ChatGPT-trained organizer is used as a baseline; it relies on generative pre-trained transformer models for its decision-making, processing text-based inputs to infer object locations and categorizations. This approach, though adept in language processing, does not integrate a structured commonsense knowledge base. Consequently, the ChatGPT-based organizer's decisions are more influenced by pre-trained patterns in textual data rather than explicit semantic relationships and intuitive logical reasoning. This can affect consistency and transparency in decision-making in complex or ambiguous scenarios, notably (but not limited to) those encountered for the first time.\nIn our comprehensive evaluation, we conduct experiments to assess the performance of Robo-CSK-Organizer and the Chat-GPT baseline across various contexts. The key aspects of these experiments are focused on ambiguity resolution, consistency, task-relevance adaptability, and explainability. A summary of our exhaustive experimentation is presented below."}, {"title": "3.1 Ambiguity Resolution", "content": "Both systems are tested on their ability to resolve ambiguous contexts using a variety of objects. Robo-CSK-Organizer as well as ChatGPT baseline perfor-"}, {"title": "3.2 Ensuring Consistency", "content": "The consistency experiments aim to evaluate the stability and repeatability of Robo-CSK-Organizer versus the ChatGPT baseline when faced with identical queries across multiple iterations. This measure of consistency is vital for reliable knowledge organization systems, as it reflects the systems' ability to consistently choose the same context for an object through numerous trials. In the methodology, objects from various categories (e.g. personal items, clothing, office supplies, and toys) are selected. Robo-CSK-Organizer achieves 100% consistency rate across all object-location pairs; this can be attributed to the static nature of the ConceptNet knowledge graphs that it utilizes in its decision-making. In contrast, the ChatGPT Organizer displays less consistency, particularly for objects such as adhesive tape, belt, sock, remote control, toothpaste, and aerosol can; possibly indicating that pre-training alone may not always yield consistent results in systematic object organization."}, {"title": "3.3 Task-Relevance Adaptability", "content": "These experiments evaluate the systems' ability to adapt their responses to different context-specific directives. The objective is to assess whether Robo-CSK-Organizer and the ChatGPT baseline can re-calibrate their responses when directed to focus on alternative contexts differing from their initial preferences. The experiments commence with an initial straightforward assessment, querying \"apple\" against 4 contexts (kitchen, living room, bedroom, bathroom) without any focused directives. This determines the systems' natural inclination or preference for context association. In the adaptability testing phase, the systems are prompted to focus on the remaining 3 contexts, one at a time, to observe if they can adapt their responses when a specific context is emphasized. This is analogous to humans adapting to different contexts in real life, e.g. if you specifically tell a human not to place apples in a kitchen (for any reason, e.g. the kitchen is too small or it is being cleaned for pest control). then the human should intuitively find another good place for the apples rather than placing them in the kitchen again. Accordingly, it is interesting to assess how robotic systems would behave in such situations.\nLikewise, data for the initial as well adaptability tests are collected by repeating each context-query 10 times. Responses are compiled into respective data frames for detailed analysis. The focused contexts for the adaptability tests are based on preference, with the most preferred context excluded to emphasize the remaining contexts. The initial phase identifies kitchen as the clear preference for sorting apples for both the ChatGPT-based organizer and Robo-CSK-Organizer. In the adaptability phase, there are observable shifts in Robo-CSK-Organizer's response, as desired, i.e. it is more adaptable when needed. The paths Robo-CSK-Organizer employs for sorting, leading to object placement, are as follows:\nPath: Kitchen (AtLocation) <- food (RelatedTo) > apple\nPath: Bedroom (AtLocation) <- house (AtLocation) <- apple"}, {"title": "3.4 Explainability", "content": "The experiment on explainability assesses the Robo-CSK-Organizer system and the ChatGPT-based system as per their abilities to elucidate their decision-making processes. This aspect is crucial for building user trust and understanding, considering the fact that there are situations where decisions may seem counter-intuitive at times. Robo-CSK-Organizer utilizes Detic for object detection, BLIP for context recognition, and ConceptNet for commonsense knowledge. It can provide logical paths for its decisions, enhancing transparency. For instance, during its incorrect placement of beer into the playroom, Robo-CSK-Organizer provides a clear logical path: playroom (UsedFor) fun (RelatedTo) party (RelatedTo) beer. This path demonstrates the connection of concepts leading to the system's conclusion. In contrast, the ChatGPT-based organizer, relying basically on deep learning models, functions as an opaque-box. It is unable to ascertain the explicit reasoning behind its decisions, e.g. placing \"scissors\" into a \"playroom\u201d (which can be a potentially hazardous decision). Hence, the ChatGPT baseline is lacking in a clear explainable framework. This can pose problems in error-correction, thus adversely impacting performance.\nThis distinction highlights that while both systems may err, analogous to the adage \"to err is human\", Robo-CSK-Organizer's explainability allows for better understanding and correction of these errors. Explainability is essential, especially in robotic systems where precision and safety are critical, contributing to user trust and understanding of AI decisions. Note that such explainability can in turn help in explicit communication with various AI systems, including intelligent agents in mobile apps, e.g. it can help to enhance existing apps with virtual voice agents [17] by adding more image-based functions where adequate object recognition is crucial. Hence, it can indirectly help a different type of robot, including a chatbot or a virtual voice assistant. All these systems would benefit from easier comprehension and enhanced interpretability. Hence, explainable AI plays a vital role here."}, {"title": "4 Discussion on Main Contributions", "content": "This research presents significant contributions to the field of AI and robotics, particularly in the development and application of commonsense knowledge for task classification in multipurpose robots.

These methodologies have significantly contributed to the field by enhancing robots' decision-making processes, adaptability, and interaction with their environment.\nOne approach focuses on using ConceptNet and Google search data for object categorization in domestic robotics, particularly for tidy-up services. This method effectively groups objects into functional categories, thereby aiding robots in more intuitive object handling [25]. Another study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 as a repository of CSK for task planning. This demonstrates the potential of language models in enriching the robotic decision-making process [34]. Furthermore, paradigms based on the classical neural networks have been adapted to many contexts, ranging from machine translation [7] in text with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to object recognition in multifaceted scenarios with computer vision models, e.g. VGG-16 [24] and ResNet-101 [13]. The issue of extracting cultural commonsense knowledge and its usefulness in enhancing chatbots has been addressed through a novel approach called CANDLE [21] with interesting real-world impacts."}, {"title": "6 Conclusions and Roadmap", "content": "Robo-CSK-Organizer is a system proposed in this paper that effectively demonstrates XAI via CSK for object organization, mitigating the challenges of non-transparent AI. Our early experiments open up areas for enhancement, e.g. decision paths from a CSK source such as ConceptNet. For instance, misplacement of high heels in the kitchen can be due to semantic overlap with stiletto as heel / knife. When this is clearly explained, potential improvements can be made. In our work, these can include refining relationships (e.g. RelatedTo) so as to provide better contextual accuracy, and using average weights in the knowledge base, not just the weight of the first edge in order to provide more robustness.

These approaches\nsuggest improvements to existing democratic alignment processes that use AI to\ncreate cases that give content to rules, allowing for more pluralist alignment.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The law must confront questions of how to reconcile competing values and views of what society\nis and should be by nature of its very form. It is a set of general rules, made by bodies recognized\nas having lawmaking authority, that bind all members of a society in the specificity of their daily\nconduct despite fundamental disagreements on how to live and what matters [27]. These general\nrules are applied to disputes in cases that, in a system of precedent, bind others in future disputes on\nsimilar points of law [24, 12, 46]. How is it possible to preserve a pluralist society that respects the\nfree choice of individuals to make their own decisions given the necessary extent to which general\nrules reduce individual freedom of choice? And how can general rules predictably be given concrete\nmeaning given the ambiguity of language and changes in circumstances?\nAlignment, particularly the kind of finetuning alignment that underlies leading large language mod-\nels, [2, 8, 33, 34, 41, 43, 37, 47] faces these same problems. Any principle or rule put into a\nmodel shapes its outputs in a way that others, including users, might find incompatible with their\nvalues, and researchers are still not certain how models interpret or will apply the rules put into them\n[21, 28, 53, 32, 22]. As Kundu et al. [38] note, simply giving a rule to a model means that the model\nwill interpret the rule based on its underlying black boxed sense of the words in which the rule is\nexpressed rather than according to what the researchers wanted. Furthermore, there may be signifi-\ncant tradeoffs between alignment to user preferences and to broader social values [35, 10]. Leading\napproaches are either the product of small groups in AI labs or, where democratic inputs have been\nsought, of majorities of those few selected to provide such input [11, 3, 23, 42]. Neither approach\npromotes pluralism. Pluralistic models must instead be able to reason contextually and from dif-\nferent perspectives, drawing on the body of alignment rules and on normal linguistic practice to\nensure that there is consistency and predictability in their outputs but also taking the perspective of\nminorities with different views from those predominant in training data or in labs [4, 36, 49, 48].\nLegal theory provides ideas that might aid in solving these problems. The law specifies its general\nrules through the application of those rules in concrete cases. In each factual dispute that forms a\ncase, an interpretation of the rule is tested and becomes precedent [5]. Over time, these interpreta-\ntions accumulate and map out not just the core meaning of a rule but also how to think about its edge"}, {"title": "2 Legal Theories for Pluralistic AI Alignment", "content": "The law has long confronted the same problems of pluralism and specification that alignment is\nnow facing, and legal scholars have developed a variety of theories for how it should respond to\nthem [27, 29, 6, 15]. Modern American law essentially makes rules at three levels: constitutional,\nstatutory, and common (judge-made),\u00b9 and takes into its scope much of life and the varieties of\nhuman interaction, making concrete norms and patterns of behavior [40]. But each law matters in\nhow it is applied in concrete cases involving the rights and obligations of people, and in fact has no\nreal meaning until such applications-advisory opinions are in fact banned in American federal courts\nto avoid groundless rulemaking [31]. The question then is how to ensure that general rules bind into\nthe future in a way that protects rights and is predictable such that people can live their lives knowing\nhow the law affects them. Two legal theories explored below suggest that cases, applications of a\nlaw over time, can fill in the meaning of general law in a way that allows for specification while\npreserving space for pluralist disagreement over values."}, {"title": "2.1 Specification Through Rules and Cases", "content": "Specifying the meaning of legal rules in a predictable and reasonable way is essential to the rule of\nlaw and to avoiding arbitrariness and abuses of power [6, 29]. But natural language is ambiguous\nand contextual. Sometimes bees are legally fish [44]. Professor H.L.A. Hart, likely still the leading\nscholar of jurisprudence [39], sought to provide an account of adjudication that showed how the\nmeaning of rules is determined in the face of what Hart called this \"open texture\" of language [27].\nThe problem that Hart saw was that ambiguity in law persisted despite attempts to add definitions\nand explanations. Hart's famous example [26] is a sample rule, perhaps made by a town council,\nthat \"forbids you to take a vehicle into the public park.\u201d At first blush, this rule seems reasonable\nand easy to understand: it disallows cars and motorcycles from entering the park. But complications\narise for cases like bicycles, roller skates, and baby strollers that seem to clearly fit the definition\nof vehicle but also seem unreasonable to exclude from the park [45]. And what about a military\ntruck intended to be mounted as a memorial [20]? An ambulance coming to the aid of a heart attack\nvictim? Further clarification of the rule is necessary to resolve these cases, and the lengthy law codes\nrisk expanding infinitely more with definitions and exceptions, each with their own definitions and\nexceptions. This specification problem is of course much worse as soon as the rule at issue moves\naway from concrete things like vehicles and toward abstractions like justice, helpfulness, bias, or\npluralism.\nHart's solution [27] is to say that in language there is a settled core of meaning and a penumbra, at\nwhich the edge cases are disputed. When an interpreter of a legal rule is at the core, they should just\napply the words at issue as the settled core dictates: no cars in the park. When they are at the fringes,\nfaced with a truly indeterminate case, they must exercise discretion to decide how to interpret the\nlanguage at issue in light of the social context, underlying goals, or other external features of the\nsituation that might provide guidance. Perhaps there's evidence that the council wanted to avoid\naccidents from high speeds: then cars are out and bikes might be too, but tricycles are in [27, 15].\nBut importantly, Hart's system has precedents, past decisions and interpretations that indicate how\na new dispute on the same issue should be resolved, and these precedents allow the bootstrapping\nof the theory of open texture into a relatively complete system of specification that retains a degree\nof flexibility and contextuality. A case is decided and a precedent interpreting some phrase made.\nAnother dispute about the phrase arises and another decision is made, this time with reference to the\nfirst one. Over time, a kind of constellation of precedent arises around the phrase at issue that allows\nfor definition of the permissible interpretations of the language at issue by means of triangulation"}, {"title": "2.2 Analogy and Incompletely Theorized Agreements", "content": "Professor Cass Sunstein took the argument a step further, claiming that in fact the law has little need\nof general principles but rather consists only of analogical reasoning among concrete cases [50],\nand that this rejection of general principles gives it a special power to protect pluralism [51]. For\nSunstein, the engine of the law is analogical reasoning:2 \u201cfixed points\" of precedent are established\nthrough judicial decisions and then new cases are decided through incremental analogy to these fixed\npoints [50, 52].3 Importantly, the justification for the decisions is less relevant than the decisions\nthemselves. Such a low-level, specific approach has important benefits for pluralism. Because\nthe law, at least in adjudication, focuses on concrete cases, there is no need for debates over high\nlevel concepts of the good or justice about which people disagree. Instead, two people might agree\nthat a given decision in the case at issue is the right one even if their philosophical justifications\nfor that decision are incompatible [51]. For Sunstein, such a mode of reasoning is necessary for\na pluralistic society because it allows for cohabitation among possibly incommensurable values.\nUnlike Hart, who believed that rules are the core of the law and cases only subsidiary ways of\ninforming their meaning, Sunstein argues that it is the cases that actually function as the core, and\nthat the announcement of general principles risks stamping out differing views.\nAlignment on particulars without consensus on principles creates what Sunstein [51] calls \"incom-\npletely theorized agreements,\" which allow for the operation of law in society subject to democratic\ncontrol and protective of plural perspectives. Incompletely theorized agreements are practical and\nconcrete and provide the substance of the \u201cfixed points,\" discussed above, from which analogical\nreasoning to bring new cases within the law can occur. While Sunstein acknowledges that certain\nhigher-level agreements are possible and indeed necessary both on some substantive questions and\nas \u201csecondary\u201d rules that provide the rules of the game that is law [52, 27], emphasizing low-level\ndecisions on concrete questions allows for people with diverse views to live together in society. Com-\nbining these pictures, we get a vision of law in which people can come to agreement on high-level\nquestions in and underlying the law where possible but still retain the ability to cooperate where\nagreement is not. Specification is improved and the ability to move across levels of agreement while\nstill creating law to address novel problems ensures that pluralism is protected."}, {"title": "3 Discussion", "content": "Alignment must represent the values of the society from which AI emerges, but existing approaches\nto incorporating democracy into alignment do not overcome either the specification or the pluralism\nproblem. Legal theory can help. Approaches like Anthropic's Collective Constitution [23], pow-\nered by reinforcement learning from AI feedback, currently cannot specify how a model should\nconcretely interpret the rules and principles that have been put into it; instead they \u201cleave[] the in-\nterpretation of [the principles] to AI systems themselves\u201d based on the models' pretraining [38].\n\"Good for humanity,\" the general principle discussed there, obviously has this problem, but, as Hart\ndemonstrated, so do all other words in rules. Simply having a group of people deliberate over what\nprinciples should be put in the model does not solve this problem and will likely lead instead to\nvague agreement over good-sounding concepts without a clear sense of what they mean. These\nexisting democratic approaches similarly struggle to preserve pluralistic values. Returning to the\nCollective Constitution as a leading example, even where the population that performs the delib-\neration is representatively selected [18], the principles selected to be put into models are chosen"}, {"title": "4 Conclusion", "content": "AI alignment faces two key problems, pluralism and specification, that legal theory can help solve.\nThe law has long faced the difficulty of how to have general rules that can be predictably applied in\nspecific situations and that avoid stamping out the forms of life of those who have other values and\nvisions of the good. Two leading legal theories suggest that the law solves these problems through\nthe use of concrete cases that fill in the meaning of general rules in their application and that provide\nspace for disagreement about values but alignment on outcomes. The map of possible meanings of a\ngiven term is filled out over time in a way that remains close to the actual meaning of practical cases,\nand people can agree on implementation while retaining different views on principle. These insights\nshould be used to supplement existing attempts to put democratic deliberation into AI, and I have\nsketched out one potential approach to doing so that makes use of large language models and their\ncapabilities to generate cases to illustrate alignment principles. However, empirical testing remains\nto be done. Collaboration between law and AI can help ensure that AI is aligned to diverse human\nvalues and that it becomes a force that helps people live their lives in the way best for them."}]}

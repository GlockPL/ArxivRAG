INTRODUCTION", "content": "MISSION design for intelligent transportation systems is tied to several challenges, mandating strict adherence to safety and security criteria. Simultaneously, representations of objectives, constraints, and execution strategies for navigating such a transportation system should be interpretable and adaptive, allowing certification of compliance with public laws and adapting to the individual operator's needs. These issues are all the more pressing when considering the employment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) applications such as logistic and emergency response systems. Although policies for AAM scenarios in human-inhabited spaces have emerged, frameworks that capture these regulations in planning and control while considering the uncertainty of background knowledge and perception, e.g., maps and deep learning models, are required.\nTo tackle these challenges, we believe that neuro-symbolic methods, integrating declarative, white-box models with powerful machine learning systems, are a promising foundation for future AAM systems. More specifically, probabilistic logic programs, e.g., as illustrated in Listing 1 and informed by querying geographic information systems such as in Listing 2, provide an adaptable and interpretable representation for the laws and uncertainties of the agent's navigation. On top of pure First-Order Logic (FOL), probabilistic logic programs assign categorical distributions to the FOL's atoms (variable-free symbols). Furthermore, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) use both discrete and continuous distributions, thereby representing a so-called hybrid relational domain where probability mass and probability density functions are assigned to the FOL simultaneously [1]. Especially in probabilistic robotics [2] where it is not enough to deal with categorical data, HPLPs are a promising research direction.\nIn contrast to research focusing on optimizing the agent's trajectory according to energy, time, or collision avoidance criteria [3]\u2013[5], we aim to enable mission design through such neuro-symbolic systems. Hence, in prior work, we introduced Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), which automatically translated uncertain, crowd-sourced map data into declarative, probabilistic programs as generative models of the likelihood of an agent's state satisfying a set of rules [6]. To this end, we will show how ProMis improves navigation by providing a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies multi-modal data sources, mission settings, and constraints into an interpretable and adaptable basis for intelligent transportation systems. ProMis generates Probabilistic Mission Landscapes, as shown in Figure 1. Each point in the agent's state space is assigned an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) probability of its likelihood to satisfy all navigation constraints from policymakers and operators alike.\nIn summary, this work makes the following key contributions to neuro-symbolic and probabilistic AAM:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nWe show how uncertain, e.g., crowd-sourced, map data can be compiled into hybrid probabilistic spatial relations as a vocabulary for expressing AAM rules in FOL, improving on the prior publication's experimental evaluation of the computational demands and time constraints.\nWe demonstrate how Transformer-based vision models such as the ChangeFormer architecture [8] can be integrated with ProMis, expanding on ProMis' expressivity and showcasing its potential for future neural-perception systems to be incorporated into mission design.\nWe employ a general-purpose LLM by first exemplifying how ProMis encodes aviation laws to automatically translate operators' natural language prompts into valid new models, illustrating how a neural system can bridge the gap between non-experts and our method.\nWe provide an Open Source implementation of the ProMis framework at https://github.com/HRI-EU/ProMis.\nBy these extensions and demonstrations, we pave the way for future intelligent transportation systems to be guided in their actions by declarative, probabilistic programs to respect a set of interpretable rules."}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORK", "content": "In Europe, the advancement of UAS and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is significantly influenced by the Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) initiative. When SESAR introduced its first Master Plan in 2009, the concept of AAM was not considered, with drones merely mentioned in passing. However, with subsequent editions of the Master Plan, particularly the 2015 release [9] and the 2017 Drone Outlook Study [10], the integration of UAS into European airspace gained momentum.\nBesides substantial funding allocated to drive development, regulations and operational restrictions have been introduced concurrently to ensure the safety of drone operations. Notably, the EU regulation 2019/947 [11], implemented in 2019, underscores the coexistence of unmanned and manned aircraft within shared airspace, emphasizing rigorous risk assessments, such as through the Specified Operations Risk Assessment (SORA method) [12].\nRecent research endeavors have enhanced safety analysis and risk assessment methodologies. For instance, Rothwell and Patzek [13] have contributed by employing satisfiability checks on symbolic models to verify and improve mission planning for UASs. In contrast, the authors of [14] highlight the importance of directly fitting the output of safety analysis and risk assessment to map or environmental data. More specifically, they propose to improve the visual representation and enable data exploration by displaying interactive representations of mission parameters. This approach improves integration with environmental data, positively impacting the effectiveness of safety analysis and risk assessment in real-world scenarios.\nSeveral studies, such as [15] and [16], have introduced approaches that integrate visual maps with risk models to calculate and visually represent risks associated with UAS operations. These models prioritize risk assessment based on formal frameworks, identifying potential hazards and safety concerns, especially ground casualties and transportation network disruptions. Even if humans are in full control, unawareness of situations may quickly lead to life-threatening scenarios. Therefore, keeping the operator or pilot informed of the ongoing mission is critical. For example, controlled flight into terrain accounts for a significant proportion of aviation fatalities [17]. For this reason, rich visualizations of the mission in progress have been developed to avoid blind spots in decision-making [18]. Inspired by air traffic management, they aim to improve flight safety by enabling operators to gain a better situational understanding and awareness of obstacles by displaying the intended trajectory and environment. By providing insight into the mission and its environment from information sources, operators can react to threats and optimize their behavior [19], [20].\nBeyond the visual line of sight, understanding the individual agent's design goals and application domain is crucial to employing autonomous agents beyond the necessity of a fine-tuned control system. For instance, in agricultural applications, robots can leverage weather forecasts to plan their missions, enabling them to determine when and how to perform tasks to, e.g., avoid wet or muddy terrain [21]. Symbolic reasoning systems are a suitable basis for an adaptable and interpretable system to formalize and verify behavior and its constraints.\nOne of the earliest programmatic reasoning systems in First-Order Logic (FOL) is Prolog [22], developed in 1972 by Alain Colmerauer. Prolog has inspired numerous applications, from natural language processing [1] to robotics [23]. Extensions that embrace uncertainties in formal logic like Bayesian Logic Programs [24] and Probabilistic Logic Programs [7], [25] have been introduced to allow for probabilistic inference in FOL models. While they are not formulated for end-to-end learning in tandem with artificial neural networks, newer models like DeepProblog [26] and SLASH [27] have been introduced to close this gap. The objective of such Neuro-Symbolic AI methods is to combine the strengths of deep learning architectures with symbolic, formally well-justified, and inherently interpretable systems. Our work is further motivated by hybrid formulations of probabilistic logic programming on which noteworthy progress has been made in recent years [1], extending syntax and semantics of probabilistic logic to account for discrete and continuous distributions."}, {"title": "III. METHODS", "content": "This section introduces an architecture for logically constrained, probabilistic mission design. With ProMis, we aim at a Probabilistic Mission design flow (see Figure 2) that addresses the needs of all involved stakeholders.\nFirst, a public body defines and regulates public traffic areas. This includes the classifications and categorizations of autonomous agents and their operations, giving rise to a need to develop safe and legally compliant mission models. In addition to creating rules for public spaces, they provide data on critical infrastructure or areas privately operated agents should not enter, e.g., geofences protecting the space around airports. Hence, the public body thereby provides static knowledge and the aforementioned laws.\nSecond, the operator of the autonomous agent determines the mission's target and additional constraints on top of legal requirements. As operators may not possess the necessary engineering expertise to program their requirements manually, intuitive interfaces are necessary. Additionally, operators with AAM-specific qualifications can directly influence what the autonomous agent is authorized to do under their supervision. While the operator's preferences cannot supersede those of the public body concerning public grounds, they can impose additional restrictions on valid missions by specifying risk-averse rules or preferences.\nThird, the manufacturer has the most extensive knowledge of the autonomous agent's capabilities for detection, localization, and tracking, facilitating the agent's perception through hardware sensors and neural information processing. For example, a logistics drone may provide estimates of its weight and camera-based localization of people below to minimize the risk for bystanders. Manufacturers may also limit vehicle use for licensing, safety, or hardware protection reasons. Therefore, they can further add to the constraints of the mission.\nProMis incorporates the contributions of these three in the form of static knowledge, laws and constraints, and agent perception. A neuro-symbolic vocabulary of spatial relations between the agent's state space and relevant geographic features, e.g., roads, buildings, or bystanders, is obtained by estimating the parameters of distributions modeling the mission environment. Hence, public, operator, and manufacturer background knowledge can be expressed in a Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Program (HPLP) to facilitate probabilistic reasoning for mission design. Overall, we make the following important contributions: (i) the architecture of ProMis, integrating multi-modal input data of AAM settings with hybrid probabilistic logic, (ii) the generation of neuro-symbolic distributional clauses from typed map data and neural perception, and (iii) the inference of Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML) as scalar fields of probabilities across the agent's mission space."}, {"title": "B. Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Relations", "content": "ProMis combines mission constraints, domain knowledge, and a regulatory framework into a single Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Program (HPLP). HPLPs intertwine formal logic with probability theory over hybrid relational spaces, i.e., categorical and continuous distributions [1]. While HPLPs are domain-agnostic models in which probabilistic logic can answer a wide range of queries, we will focus on treating data for UAV navigation in this section. We will consider three types of data sources as background knowledge K: Static knowledge, e.g., geographic features such as the placement of roads or buildings, agent perception retrieved from hardware sensors and machine learning models, e.g., neural networks for bystander detection, and the operator status, e.g., their location or what license they hold.\nTo parameterize the generated HPLP from this data, we propose Probabilistic Clause Modules (PCM) as a collection of mappings from application-specific data models in K into a set of parameters of continuous and categorical distributions D. Hence, each entry in this distributional knowledge base D relates a spatial relation a to its probability p or its distribution's parameters \u03b8. This means that logical propositions in HPLPs can not only be true or false but rather follow discrete or continuous distributions to parameterize the probability of a solution to the modeled problem:\n$p :: a:- l_1, l_2, ..., l_n.$\t(Discrete)\n$a ~ p(\u03b8) :- l_1, l_2, ..., l_n.$\t(Continuous)\nThis means if the right-hand side conjunction of literals $l_i$ is true, head a is true with probability p, or its value follows the distribution $p(\u03b8)$. If the right-hand side is empty, we consider a a fact independent of any other symbols. This formalization of knowledge in uncertain domains is especially interesting when considering uncertain spatial relations from neural sensors, crowd-sourced maps, or low-cost sensory equipment. Consider the binary spatial relations $over(x, t)$ and $distance(x, t)$, telling whether the agent state x is located over a geographic feature of type t, e.g., a building or person on the ground, and the distance of x to such a type t. We will show (i) how these parameters can be obtained through statistical means from uncertain geographic data in Section III-B and (ii) the integration of deep learning architectures in Section IV-B.\nLet a map $M = (V,E,T)$ be a triple of vertices V, edges E and tagging function \u03c4. Each vertex v is located in a d-dimensional space $R^d$ of Cartesian coordinates. If a path exists between two vertices in V across edges in E, they are part of the same feature f. For each vertex $v \u2208 V$, the function $\u03c4(v) = T$ produces a set T of tags belonging to v.\nTo obtain an HPLP representation of a map M, ProMis requires a generative model of map features to extract parameters of probabilistic spatial relations. To model the spatial error in the stored vertices, we utilize an affine transformation, i.e., a translation and a linear map, as a model. Analogous to prior work [28], we consider for each $v_{i,j} \u2208 V$, being the j-th vertex of the i-th feature, the following affine map:\n$\u03a6(\u03b7) \u2190 \u03c6(\u03b1_i)$\t(Transformation)\n$t(\u03b7) + k_{i,j}(\u03b2_i)$\t(Translation)\n$v^{(\u03b7)}_{i,j} = \u03c6^{(\u03b7)}(\u03b1_i) \u00b7 v_{i,j} + t^{(\u03b7)}(\u03b2_i)$\t(Generation)\nHere, $\u03c6(\u03b1_i)$ and $k_{i,j}$ are parameterized generators of N linear maps $\u03c6^{(\u03b7)}(\u03b1_i)$ and translations $t^{(\u03b7)}(\u03b2_i)$. Obtaining a collection of N randomized maps $M^{(\u03b7)}$ samples then allows for empirically estimating the parameters of hybrid probabilistic spatial relations using a testing function $j(M^{(\u03b7)}, x, t)$.\nConsider the running examples of $over(x,t)$ and $distance(x, t)$ as discrete probability and continuously distributed random variables, respectively, relating state x and environment feature of type t. We draw random maps and sample the spatial relations' value for state x and type t to compute the distributions' respective parameters. Via this process, we"}, {"title": "C. Probabilistic Mission Landscapes", "content": "We now introduce the concept of Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML) $L_p(x) = y$, a scalar field over an agent's state space x. A PML represents the success probability y\u2208 [0,1] of querying the HPLP P for the landscape atom at the respective location. Given the mission as background knowledge, constraints, and inference parameters described before, ProMis achieves this in three steps. First, a First-Order Logic solver grounds P, translating it into a variable-free, propositional form with only ground atoms A. Second, the grounded program is solved into a Conjunctive Normal Form, enumerating all models $m \u2208 M$ for which the landscape relation's right-hand side literals are all true, and each atom $a \u2208 A$ is assigned a Boolean value. Finally, the probabilities of the models are summed up in a grid of probabilities for a legal and safe arrival at each location:\n$L_p(x) = \\sum_{m \\in M} \\prod_{a \\in A} P(a = m(a))$\nNote that the probability of the continuous distributions is either achieved via the Cumulative Distribution Function or through sampling, depending on whether a closed-form solution is available. Since efficient solving and inference schemes are out-of-scope for the presentation of ProMis, we refer to state-of-the-art tools for inference in HPLPs, e.g., Hybrid Relational ProbLog [1]\nThe PML is computed for a pre-defined set of states x within the mission environment. For example, given an origin point, dimensions towards east and north, and a resolution, a raster of points can be evaluated from which the PML is completed using, e.g., linear interpolation. Our experiments on ProMis and PML generation show not only the outcome in terms of estimated parameters and PMLs but also the complexity of running these tasks for different choices of granularity and environments."}, {"title": "IV. EXPERIMENTS", "content": "We start our experiments by demonstrating the computation of two spatial relations from crowd-sourced, i.e., often unreliable, map data. Namely, we consider the over(x, building) and distance(x, road) spatial relations. To this end, we query data from OpenStreetMap using Overpass akin to Listing 2. For the map generation process, we assume the geometry to have a simple translational error, which we draw from a Gaussian $t ~ N(0, diag(10m, 10m))$ and uniformly apply to all vertices of the same feature. For this experiment, we place the origin of the mission space in Darmstadt, Germany (latitude = 49.878091, longitude = 8.654052). Further, we compute the parameters on a 1000 \u00d7 1000 raster using the method of moments, as presented in Section III, from 50 generated maps in a 1 km\u00b2 area. The so-obtained parameters are visualized in Figure 4."}, {"title": "B. Neural Perception in Probabilistic Mission Design", "content": "Beyond statistical analysis of, e.g., geographic information systems, neural perception is an important ingredient in ProMis's ability to reason based on the agent's immediate surroundings. Hence, in this section, we consider the classification output of a Transformer-based vision model for inclusion in the generated HPLP. While the potential for neural perception is vast, ranging from locating bystanders on the ground to detecting forest fires, we will consider change detection from satellite images as an example of translating neural perception into spatial relations. For this, we have trained a ChangeFormer [8] following the training approach described in [29], employing the LEVIR-CD dataset [30] to learn to detect salient changes from satellite images.\nThe LEVIR-CD dataset is an urbanization monitoring dataset featuring before and after image pairs of developing suburbs, e.g., allowing the ChangeFormer to detect construction sites and newly finished buildings. Further, the ChangeFormer is a Siamese-like architecture that applies feature extraction on four scales to both the before- and after-images. Next, the features are compared via a learned difference module, and the resulting comparison features are fed through fully connected up-sampling layers to produce the change map. Hence, each pixel of the change map corresponds to a categorical distribution indicating the probability of being a change.\nWe choose this example for two reasons: First, regardless of semantics, generating HPLP relations from the ChangeFormer output is analogous to any other neural perception that can be mapped to the agent's navigation space. Second, besides encoding the ChangeFormer's output into the HPLP and providing a more expressive language for mission design, its semantics can be leveraged to detect outdated map data. Hence, as seen in Figure 5, neural perception is not only a more dynamic form of obtaining mission-related knowledge but opens up the ability to reason on the differences between multiple modes of input data. Of course, the same reasoning goes in reverse, with the map data being more complete than the ChangeFormer's detection.\nListing 3 depicts how the ChangeFormer detections are integrated into the HPLP as new spatial relation change(x). Here, each probability of the output is analogous to the demonstration of the over(x, t) relation, written as the conditional probability of the HPLP fact. In contrast to prior work, the relation is unary and not connected to a specific type due to the less specific semantics of the ChangeFormer."}, {"title": "C. Reasoning on Neuro-Symbolic Navigation Spaces", "content": "In the previous two sections, we demonstrated the creation of three spatial relations based on statistical geographic data and neural perception. Now, we integrate this data for various locations and application scenarios into HPLPs and present possible outcomes of employing ProMis.\nFirst, consider Listing 4. It encodes a simple set of mission constraints for an AAM scenario in an inner-city environment. For example, the UAV's valid airspace is confined to parks and areas near major roads. Further, Visual-Line-of-Sight (VLOS) is required and modeled as dependent on the weather and the distance to the operator located at the center of the mission space. Figure 6 visualizes these three conditions and the resulting landscape(x). We have applied the same mission parameters (origin, extends, and resolution) as in Section IV-A. In Figure 7, we further show ProMis being applied to a broad set of scenarios with differently chosen flight restrictions.\nFirst, the full model of Listing 4 is shown, including a condition on the agent's battery charge to be sufficient to return to the operator's location. Second, we apply ProMis to a Bay Area, where we augment the definition of VLOS to extend over open waters if the weather is clear, demonstrating how relating rules to the GIS-provided tagging system can lead to different behaviors based on the underlying map and uncertain weather conditions. The third scenario is a pedestrian crossing in a metropolitan environment where the UAV cannot enter the airspace above the roads. An exception is made for crossings while the traffic light shows green, showing how local perception or connections to other traffic systems may be leveraged here. Finally, a scenario in which the UAV can fly over a rail network used for passenger and cargo transport is shown. Here, the UAV is forbidden to stray from the rails or base station. A threshold over the PML further facilitates planning in mission design, as shown in Figure 7."}, {"title": "D. Probabilistic Mission Design with Large Language Models", "content": "Because ProMis allows us to limit the operations of an agent by First-Order Logic, we can leverage the fact that Large Language Models (LLM) can generate program code from natural language descriptions. We employ ChatGPT\u00b9 as LLM to demonstrate this approach. To do so, we must tell the LLM what a ProMis program is and describe its elements. For this, we pass Listing 4 together with the request of translating the following prompts into equivalent ProMis code, underlining the need for the landscape clause to be included and to use the distance and over relations as exemplified. Then, we can provide the mission description of an operator who cannot or likes to avoid engineering the First-Order Logic required by ProMis. Figure 8 shows the operator's prompt, describing their situation and mission requirements in natural language, the LLM's response, the generated ProMis program, and the computed PML. However, creating a fine-tuned model is desirable to avoid errors, e.g., hallucinations, in the generated code. Further, the LLM's decisions, e.g., distance boundaries, might not align with the operator's intentions and require additional interactions."}, {"title": "E. Parallelization and Interpolation in ProMis", "content": "To assess the suitability of PML for mission design, we need to analyze the time taken to compute landscapes at different resolutions. Without further strategy, the inference time will grow quadratically in the resolution. This means obtaining high-resolution PMLs quickly becomes impractical, even on a powerful computation device. Time measurements have been obtained on an 8-core Intel i7 9700K.\nFirst, we consider how much time the ProMis pipeline needs to spend for each individual step in Figure 9. This evaluation shows how computing the parameters, i.e., the steps demonstrated in Section IV-A, dominates the time taken for computing a full PML. In the second place, running the inference itself is costly, i.e., evaluating the sum-product obtained for the generated and solved HPLP query. On the other hand, generating the HPLP and solving the logic are minor expenses within ProMis.\nBecause of how ProMis generates the HPLP and the landscape(x) is defined, the probability distributions of each location in the navigation frame are identically and independently distributed. Therefore, we can split the inference task into multiple processes, parallelize the task, and reduce computation time while retaining exact inference. When splitting the area s-times into four equal parts with each step, we obtain $4^s$ smaller models to process in parallel. The impact on ProMis' runtime is shown in Figure 10.\nTiling is an important consideration, and the tiling factor is a parameter with a critical impact on computation time. Furthermore, tiling also allows for distributing work across multiple computing devices. One might prioritize computing tiles close to the agent first and queue up the rest for a later inference cycle. Of course, since tiling makes use of parallel computing, moving the inference algorithms to a manycore processor is a promising direction for future work.\nSampling a high-resolution PML can be necessary for the mission's success and safety. However, the ideal resolution will depend on the employed model and geography, with oversampling possibly wasting time and energy. Hence, it is important to discuss the impact of choosing higher or lower resolutions in the first place. Depending on the lateral and longitudinal extension of the inference area and the frequency of spatial complexity in the map, the resolution can be chosen lower without losing much accuracy.\nTo this end, we analyze the loss of accuracy compared to a reference PML computed in a high resolution in the previously shown scenarios of Figure 7. We do so by running ProMis at the same origin points and dimensions with a change in resolution. Then, each PML is upscaled using linear interpolation and compared to the reference PML with a 200 x 200 resolution. Figure 11 shows the results for each scenario individually. A trade-off between landscape quality and runtime needs to be considered here. For instance, delaying the start of a mission to investigate the potential task space may be appropriate for a user but infeasible if quick decisions need to be made by the UAV itself. Hence, ProMis might greatly benefit from adaptive sampling schemes that decide online how many samples of the PML need to be taken and at what locations."}, {"title": "V. CONCLUSION", "content": "We have presented ProMis, a neuro-symbolic architecture for Probabilistic Mission Design based on Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs. ProMis facilitates adaptable and interpretable mission design by encoding quasi-static and dynamic knowledge, e.g., geographic map data and neural agent perception, into First-Order Logic parameterized by discrete and continuous distributions. The hybrid probabilistic nature of the underlying inference mechanisms allows for considering many types of input data and relations of real-world robot navigation tasks, such as discrete occupancy probabilities or continuous distance measures.\nProMis produces Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML), scalar fields of probabilities over the agent's state-space expressing how likely the underlying model is satisfied given the uncertain input data. Hence, ProMis facilitates advanced mission design tasks such as granting clearance to a trajectory, explaining why clearance was denied, or choosing an optimal mission setting, e.g., as shown in [31]. Legal, operator, and manufacturer background knowledge can be considered in navigation tasks through manual encodings of a domain expert's requirements or automatic translation from natural language by employing an LLM.\nMoving forward, some limitations require investigation. First, ProMis' application is limited if the parameters of spatial relations need frequent recomputation, i.e., sampling and computing the distribution parameters prohibits fast updates to the PML. Second, solving the logical query of the HPLP can become an expensive task with complex mission constraints or when a larger variety of spatial relations is introduced. Finally, updating the belief expressed in the PML under real-time requirements demands advances in knowledge compilation and reasoning techniques, e.g., incorporating caching mechanisms for quasi-static parts of the solving process.\nNevertheless, we have shown that ProMis intertwines important stakeholders and the autonomous agent, serving transparency and adaptation to human input while providing inference on mission-related, uncertain values. Overall, we believe that ProMis provides an effective foundation for Advanced Aerial Mobility where low-level perception and high-level rules go hand in hand."}]}

Such a definition\nencompasses all four main types of AI technology:\ni.\n\"Type 1\" AI refers to purely \u201creactive\u201d machines that specialize in one area or task. For\ninstance, the drafting and review of loan agreements. More \u201cfamous\u201d examples would\nbe IBM's Deep Blue chess software or Google's Alpha Go algorithm for playing Go;\nii.\n\u201cType 2 AI\u201d machines possess just enough memory or \u201cexperience\u201d to make proper\ndecisions and execute appropriate actions in specific situations or contexts. Self-\ndriving cars, chatbots, or personal digital assistants are the most commonly cited\nexamples;\niii.\n\"Type 3\" Al has the capacity to understand thoughts and emotions which affect human\nbehavior. Softbank Robotic's \u201cPepper\u201d can organize large amounts of data and\ninformation in order to have a \u201chuman-like\u201d conversation;\niv.\n\u201cType 4 AI\u201d is \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d as it is typically portrayed in Hollywood movies\nor TV shows (think HBO's Westworld). Machines using this type of AI are self-aware,\nsuper-intelligent, sentient and are presumed to possess something like consciousness.\nThe advantage of an expansive definition of this kind is that it highlights the urgency of AI-\nrelated developments and avoids the risks of complacency. If we define AI narrowly in terms\nof Type 4 AI - i.e., AI that is \u201cmore human than human\u201d \u2013 we don't need to be overly concerned\nwith the disruptive impact and potential effects of such technologies at the moment. After all,\n\"singularity\u201d \u2013 the moment when AI capacities surpass our own\nseems to be some decades\naway. The advantage of a broader definition of AI is that it, therefore, allows us to appreciate\nthe extent and diversity of the business challenges that are already created by AI and allows us\nto develop a portfolio of possible regulatory strategies appropriate for managing such\ntechnologies. Moreover, all aspects of business operations seem likely to be affected by at least\none of these four types of AI, and such disruption is already occurring across multiple sectors\nof the economy.\nTake the example of financial services. There are many tasks that are central to financial\nservices that can already be better performed by machines. Type 1 AI can do certain things\nmore effectively than a human (for instance, reviewing large numbers of standard form\ncontracts). Even though Type 4 AI may be a long way off that doesn't mean that the financial\nservices industry isn't already being disrupted by other, \u201csimpler,\u201d forms of machine\nintelligence.\nFintech - broadly defined as the use of new technologies to make financial services, ranging\nfrom online lending to digital currencies, more efficient can already be seen across a range\nof financial services and many of these new services involve some kind of AI, in the broad"}, {"title": "2.2 AI-Driven Investment, Start-Ups & a New Market for Corporate Control", "content": "The result of these technological and business developments is that AI is attracting record\namounts of investors' money. Consider global venture capital investments in AI, which\nincreased significantly between 2012 and 2016, both in terms of absolute amount invested and\nthe number of deals"}, {"title": "2.3 AI Technologies & Radical Uncertainty", "content": "A final point regarding the challenge of AI technologies. As Types of Al develop more\nuncertainties will inevitably occur, particularly as we approach \u201csingularity\", and this\nhighlights a transformation in the character of risk. A paradox of digital technologies is that\nthey make our lives easier, but they also make the world harder \u2013 perhaps even impossible \u2013 to\nunderstand. The digital world is a world of risk \u2013 of identifiable and measurable dangers \u2013 but,\nmore significantly, it is also a world of radical uncertainty. Our relationship with new\ntechnology is often characterized by uncertainty, in the sense that \u201call we know is that there\nare many things that we do not know\u201d about a technology and its effects.\nThe speed of technological development means that transformative change will come much\nsooner than expected. Big data and the near-endless amounts of information have undoubtedly\ntransformed Al to unprecedented levels. Blockchain technology and smart contracts will\nmerely continue and, very probably, accelerate the trend. The enormous increase in\ncomputational power, the breakthrough of \u201cInternet of Things\u201d applications and the further\ndevelopment of smart machines will only accelerate Al's development and global adoption.\nThe acceleration of innovation will add to Al's ability to adapt to new situations and solve\nproblems that currently seem to be impossible.\nAny list of potential outcomes \u2013 positive or negative \u2013 created by new technologies is always\ngoing to be incomplete. As such, the digital world is a world where \u201creality\u201d and \u201ctruth\"\nregarding new technologies are uncertain, unsettled and constantly being contested.\nIn part, this is simply a function of the ever-quickening speed of technological change. As\nsoon as we believe that we have a clear understanding, a new development has already occurred\nthat renders any existing understanding obsolete. But something else is also going on.\n\"Understanding\" of complex man-made systems is now increasingly \"beyond\" human\ncomprehension. For the first time in history, we live in a world where more and more\ntechnologies are simply beyond human comprehension.\nSo how can business and regulators meet this AI challenge? In this chapter, two potentially\nfruitful strategies are introduced and explored. First, new forms of regulation, notably\nregulatory sandboxes (Section 3), and, second, innovation ecosystems that foster partnerships\nbetween established firms and startups (Section 4).\""}, {"title": "3 \"Responsive\u201d / \u201cSmart\u201d / \u201cDynamic\u201d Regulation", "content": "Recently, the regulation literature\nparticularly that branch of the discussion focusing on the\nregulation of new and disruptive technologies has focused on improving the ability of\nregulators to respond to changing industry practices (especially technology-driven changes)"}, {"title": "3.1 Regulatory Sandboxes", "content": "In the financial industry, it has recently been suggested that such an engaged-approach with\ndisruptive technology is best facilitated by the establishment of regulatory sandboxes.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the financial regulatory body in the United\nKingdom, is widely accredited with first introducing this approach. In April 2016, the FCA\nbroke new ground by announcing the introduction of a regulatory sandbox which allows both\nstart-up and established companies to \u201ctest\u201d new ideas, products and business models in the\narea of Fintech.\nThe aim of the sandbox is to create: a \u201csafe space\u201d in which businesses can test innovative\nproducts, services, business models and delivery mechanisms without immediately incurring\nall the normal regulatory consequences of engaging in the activity in question.\nThe idea behind the sandbox is for the state regulator to approve a firm-specific, de-\nregulated space for the testing of innovative products and services without being forced to\ncomply with the applicable set of existing rules and regulations. With the sandbox, the\nregulator aims to foster innovation by lowering regulatory barriers and costs for testing\ndisruptive innovative technologies, while ensuring that consumers will not be negatively\naffected. The three key questions that were investigated by the FCA on the sandbox proposal\nconcerned \u201cregulatory barriers\u201d (how and to what extent can they be lowered?), \u201csafeguards\u201d\n(what protector measures should be in place to ensure safety), and \u201clegal framework\u201d (what\nregulatory arrangement is mandated by EU law).\nWhat is perhaps most interesting about the sandbox is that new ideas, products and services\ncan be tested in a \u201clive,\u201d \u201creal world\u201d environment. As such, firms are given the authorization\nto test their products or strategies without being subjected to existing regulatory requirements\nand the associated prohibitions or compliance costs. In order to create this environment,\nthe FCA has defined a set of default parameters that can be altered on a case-by-case basis,\ndepending on the needs of a particular firm. These parameters include:\ni. Duration. As a default, the FCA considers three to six months to be an appropriate\nlength of time to 'test' a particular innovation."}, {"title": "3.2 An Empirical Test", "content": "In order to explore empirically the effects of a more dynamic regulatory approach to disruptive\nnew technologies, a small empirical study was conducted, focusing on the example of Fintech.\nBroadly speaking, if we look around the world today we can distinguish between two broad\ncategories of regulatory response\n\u201creactive\u201d and \u201cproactive\u201d\nboth of which comprise a\nnumber of sub-categories.\nOn the one hand, there are what we can characterize as reactive jurisdictions. This includes\ncountries in which nothing is being done, i.e., there is currently no regulatory talk or action\nresponding to Fintech. A second sub-group consists of those countries in which there is only\npartial or fragmented regulation of Fintech. Certain institutions, such as the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau in the United States, may offer certain safe harbor provisions for\ncertain type of Fintech companies. Yet, there appears to be little willingness to genuinely\nembrace the technology and its regulatory implications, nor is there any comprehensive plan\nas to how Fintech can or should be regulated.\nOn the other hand, are those countries that take a more a proactive approach. In this group,\nwe find those countries that make Fintech a strategic priority. In such countries, more\nregulatory attention paid to Fintech. Again, a number of sub-categories can be identified.\nA first sub-group comprises countries in which such \u201cattention\u201d takes the form of\nconsultation papers, White Papers, or conferences. Of course, there is a risk that such \u201ctalk\u201d\ncan slide into empty \u201clip service\u201d aimed at projecting an image of regulatory action when, in\nreality, action is limited or non-existent.\nA second sub-group of countries engage in what we might characterize as \u201cregulatory\nguidance.", "regulatory\nexperimentation.": "egulators create a sandbox in which they facilitate and encourage a space\nto experiment.

It has consistently ranked as the best location for launching a new business with\nglobal aspirations. Silicon Valley attracts the most funding, it is the most connected and it\noffers the most opportunities for both innovators and entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley has\nrepresented the best bet for anyone with serious aspirations of creating a global business in\nhigh growth sectors of the economy.\nAs a result of this success, policymakers have been drawn to the idea of recreating the\nsuccess of Silicon Valley in other parts of the world. Initially, this discussion focused on\nstrategies for promoting investment. Generally, this involved two primary types of public\nintervention into the venture capital market, namely (i) by regulation or de-regulation, which\nhas impact either on the supply side (e.g., on venture capital firms) or on the demand side (e.g.,\non start-ups) or by (ii) direct public investment schemes. While regulation-de-regulation\naimed at creating an enabling environment for private actors to develop their activities, the\ndirect intervention in form of investment schemes effectively enables governmental agencies\nto fund start-ups in particular sectors and influence investor's behavior.\nYet, clearly more is needed than investment promotion. There is now a much greater\nawareness of how the success of Silicon Valley is more than just about investment. There is an\nenormous literature that aims to provide a better understanding of what is needed, in particular\nseeking to identify the \u201cingredients"}, {"title": "4.2 Building the \u201cRight Kind\" of AI Ecosystem I: The EU Experience", "content": "The question that therefore needs to be asked is: How to Build the \u201cRight Kind\u201d of AI\nEcosystem? National and local governments all now see start-up ecosystems as a necessity for\npreparing for the future. Putting in place the necessary infrastructure to stimulate the creation,\ngrowth and scaling of new and innovative business is now seen as an important and legitimate\npolicy objective for all levels of government.\nSo, what can governments do to build an effective innovation ecosystem? Traditionally, the\nfocus of policymakers looking to create an innovation ecosystem has been on making more\nrisk capital available for start-up and scale-up companies.\nTake Europe as an example. Recently, we can see a steady decline in venture capital activity\nat all the stages of a start-up's development. This tracks the worldwide trend (according to\nthe data provider and analyst Pitchbook). What appears to be even more worrying is that right\nnow the activity in first-time venture investments is the lowest for over seven years.\nIn order to stimulate venture capital investments, governments have used several strategies.\nFirst, there is long-standing evidence that government support has played a vital role in\nencouraging entrepreneurship and the launch of start-up companies. For example,"}, {"title": "4.3 Building the \u201cRight Kind\u201d of AI Ecosystem II: The Role of \u201cIncumbents\"", "content": "A big part of the solution involves tapping into the experience and know-how of established\nenterprises. For instance, large, global established corporations often recognize that they must\nengage with AI, robotics and automation. They have the motive and resources to play a crucial\nrole. And yet, all too often, existing corporate culture and governance structures mean that older,\nestablished firms struggle to adjust to new realities. Twentieth-century companies rely too\nheavily on hierarchical, formal and closed organizations. As such, they are ill-prepared to make\nthe bold and agile business decisions necessary to succeed in a world of constant disruptive\ninnovation.\nTo survive it is, therefore, imperative for established firms to re-invent their own innovation\nstrategies. This means understanding how to organize for innovation, building and improving\non the valuable lessons from the Silicon Valley experience. Crucially, younger firms in the\ninnovation sector are typically organized around the kind of governance principles that provide\nthem with the energy and ideas to constantly innovate, namely a \u201cflat\u201d organization, \u201copen\ncommunication\u201d and a \u201cbest-idea-wins-culture.\"\nSince these governance principles are more likely to be found in the organization of start-up\ncompanies, the \u201csmartest\u201d large corporations try to gain access to this\nwhat Elon Musk has\ntermed the \u201cSilicon Valley operating system\u201d by cultivating open and inclusive partnerships\nwith entrepreneurs, founders and start-ups in the innovation space. When multiple established\ncorporations build relationships of this kind, the basis for a flourishing ecosystem can be put in\nplace. But to build a network, community or ecosystem around this new type of partnership, two\nprocesses need to be better understood and embraced. In this way, large corporations can\nbecome the crucial link in building innovation ecosystems.\nMost obviously, such linkage can drive the kind of genuine opportunities for serendipity\nhighlighted by Hwang and Horrowit discussed above. The first strategy is for established\nenterprises to use corporate incubator and accelerator programs to put in place an open\narchitecture that offers opportunities for mutual learning. Start-up founder and employees can\nthen get to routinely mix with corporate employees. Such programs have become popular in\nrecent years. In 2017, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, General Electric and Telef\u00f3nica all announced\nthe opening of new accelerator programs in France, India, the United Kingdom and the United\nStates (see Figure 6).\nThe initial and mutual advantages of such an approach seem obvious:\ni.\nFor Established Corporations. Corporate incubator and accelerator programs allow\nlarge firms to engage alongside start-ups and their founders. Such collaborations give\nthem access to ideas and strategies they would never be able to nurture internally.\nii.\nFor Start-up Companies. Corporate incubator and accelerator programs are\nparticularly interesting if there is a good cultural match. They can provide start-ups\nwith the necessary capital and deliver tremendous resources in the form of access to\nrelevant knowledge and established international distribution channels."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "A well-run innovation ecosystem provides multiple benefits for society in general. It creates the\nnecessary links between complementary sources of risk finance and entrepreneurs. Also, it helps\nbuild the capacity of entrepreneurs to identify future partners that are best suited to deliver a\nmeaningful, long-term relationship and give a young firm the best chance of developing its\nproduct and scaling successfully. Finally, such an ecosystem helps policymakers develop the\n\"know-how\" to implement more dynamic and responsive forms of regulation. In the \"right kind\"\nof ecosystem environment, flexible and inclusive processes benefit startups and established\ncompanies, regulators, experts and the public.\nThe ultimate goal is to prepare local and regional ecosystems for a world with a very different\nlevel of automation and artificial intelligence. Having a working strategy gives them a credible\nchance of competing with Silicon Valley. This chapter has identified two promising elements\nof such an ecosystem that are particularly relevant in the context of AI-related technologies,\nnamely regulatory sandboxes and partnerships between AI startups and incumbent corporations.\nSuch an approach seems to bring clear and tangible benefits to all major stakeholders in such\ninnovation ecosystems and has the potential to deliver significant benefits to the community at\nlarge."}]}

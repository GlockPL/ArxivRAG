INTRODUCTION", "content": "SuperCoder2.0 is an advanced autonomous system designed to enhance software development through artificial intelligence. Combining an AI-native development platform with intelligent agents, it allows for fully autonomous coding, particularly in Python. This system introduces several innovative features such as an advanced retry mechanism with error output traceback, comprehensive code rewriting to avoid linting issues, a unique code embedding technique for retrieval-augmented generation, and a focus on localising methods for problem-solving rather than identifying specific line numbers. Current Landscape of Autonomous Systems in Software Development The domain of AI-assisted development has seen substantial research and development. Techniques such as automated code generation, error detection, and project management have demonstrated significant improvements in developer productivity and code quality. Research on AI-native platforms emphasizes the importance of integrating AI models into the development lifecycle to enhance deployment fluidity and operational efficiency. In this context, autonomous systems like OpenAI's Codex [1], which powers GitHub Copilot, exemplify AI's potential to transform traditional coding practices by enabling more intuitive coding environments and reducing manual efforts. Techniques such as RAG [2], combining strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models, are pivotal in enhancing contextually accurate code suggestions.\nSuperCoder2.0 incorporates advanced error handling and retry mechanisms, critical for autonomous systems. These features minimize debugging time and enhance robustness through proactive error management, automated retries, and error output traceback. The implementation of error output traceback and automated retries in SuperCoder2.0 aligns with advanced techniques seen in recent studies, which highlight the importance of learning from previous mistakes to improve AI model performance. Research demonstrates that proper error handling can significantly reduce manual debugging efforts and improve overall system reliability [3] [4]. The comprehensive approach of code rewriting of SuperCoder2.0 involves rewriting the entire files to avoid linting issues, a method that ensures a consistent and cohesive codebase. This technique is crucial for maintaining code quality and avoiding fragmented, inconsistent updates, a challenge frequently noted in modern software development practices. Leveraging RAG, particularly with specialized code embeddings, SuperCoder2.0 enhances its ability to provide relevant and accurate code suggestions. This is especially pertinent given the growing body of research advocating for improved accuracy and relevance in AI-driven code assistance tools. The embedding of code documents using the code embeddings instead of traditional embeddings,"}, {"title": "II. LITERATURE SURVEY", "content": "The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, particularly in large language models (LLMs), has improved the development of autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks managed by humans. This is especially true in the domain of software development, where the integration of AI-driven autonomous agents is increasingly adopted. Autonomous Software Development Systems are evolving to automate various phases of the software lifecycle, from requirements gathering and design to coding, testing, and maintenance. One such benchmark, SWE-bench [6], has emerged as a pivotal tool in assessing the capabilities of language models in performing software engineering tasks autonomously. SWE-bench is designed to measure the effectiveness of language models in handling tasks that range from basic code comprehension to more complex activities such as code synthesis and bug fixing. The benchmark provides a structured evaluation environment, offering a diverse set of challenges that reflect real-world software development scenarios. SWE-bench has been instrumental in highlighting the strengths and limitations of various autonomous systems. For instance, it has been used to compare the performance of different LMs in coding tasks, revealing significant variations in their ability to understand and generate syntactically correct and semantically meaningful code. SWE-bench has played a crucial role in driving innovation in the development of more sophisticated LMs. Providing a clear set of performance metrics encourages researchers and developers to push the boundaries of what these models can achieve. The benchmark has been vital in identifying areas where current models fall short, such as in handling highly complex or creative tasks that require deep contextual understanding. LLMs like GPT-4 by OpenAI and Claude by Anthropic are pivotal in advancing autonomous software development. Initially, LLMs were designed to handle basic natural language processing tasks, including translation and summarization. Their potential in code generation became evident with early models like GPT-2, which could generate simple [7]. Over time, models like GPT-4 have shown marked improvements in both the accuracy and complexity of generated code, evolving from handling basic tasks to performing sophisticated programming activities [8]. GPT-4 builds on its predecessors' architectures with enhanced capabilities, trained on vast and diverse datasets, enabling it to understand complex programming languages and generate more sophisticated code. Its ability to interpret nuanced queries and produce functional code makes it a powerful tool for automating software development tasks [9].\nClaude, with its focus on safety and alignment, has developed robust mechanisms to generate precise, error-free code, ensuring higher reliability in autonomous coding systems [10]. The emphasis on reducing biases and achieving high fidelity in generated code has made Claude particularly beneficial for applications that require safe and reliable outputs. Through iterative training on extensive and varied datasets, Claude ensures the correct semantic interpretation of programming tasks, thus generating precise and dependable code [11]. These models demonstrate the potential to automate various aspects of software development, providing a technical backbone for more sophisticated autonomous coding systems.\nThe incorporation of LLMs into autonomous agents represents a significant leap toward realizing fully autonomous software development systems. Frameworks like LangChain enable LLMs to function as part of autonomous agents capable of executing complex tasks with minimal human intervention [12]. These agents can request and utilize information, develop strategies, and make decisions based on the extensive knowledge embedded in the LLMs, significantly enhancing their capabilities in autonomous coding environments. Methodologies like Reasoning and Acting (ReACT) and Chain-of-Thought (COT) further enhance the application of LLMs.\nReACT integrates reasoning with action, enabling LLMs to autonomously devise and execute plans, crucial in real-time coding environments [13]. This approach leverages the model's reasoning capabilities to interpret tasks and generate corresponding actions autonomously. By integrating structured reasoning and action-based planning, ReACT empowers LLMs to handle complex coding tasks with greater accuracy and consistency [14]. COT further improves the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs by breaking down tasks into sequential steps, enhancing their ability to generate coherent and functional code [15]. This step-by-step reasoning approach allows models to process and address each part methodically, making it particularly effective in software development where logical sequences and dependencies are critical. Studies have revealed that COT prompting enhances an LLM's capacity to generate clear and coherent code by improving its logical reasoning processes [16].\nThe capability of LLMs to generate code has been extensively researched, demonstrating the profound impact these models can have on software development. Benchmark datasets like CodeXGLUE evaluate and advance LLM capabilities in code-related tasks, highlighting how pre-trained models can be fine-tuned for specific applications [17]. This benchmark includes a suite of tasks designed to test various aspects of code intelligence, from code completion to translation between different programming languages. Research efforts have developed tools like GitHub Copilot, built on advanced LLMs like Codex, a descendant of GPT-3, which"}, {"title": "III. METHODOLOGY", "content": "This section elucidates the operational framework of SuperCoder2.0, focusing on its approach to codebase navigation and issue resolution. The methodology addresses two critical aspects of automated debugging: [33] efficient codebase traversal with precise localization of the target code section, and [34] generation and implementation of corrective code. While individual components of this approach have precedents in existing literature, the novel integration and sequential application of these elements yield significant performance improvements. The methodology is bifurcated into two primary phases: Search and Edit. The Search phase employs a hierarchical approach to narrow down the problem space, while the Edit phase utilizes advanced code generation and modification techniques. This structured approach enables SuperCoder2.0 to effectively navigate complex codebases and implement targeted solutions, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in autonomous software development tasks. The system leverages state-of-the-art language models, specifically GPT-4 and Claude Sonnet 3.5, for code generation and analysis tasks, while Jina Code Embeddings are utilized for efficient code retrieval and semantic search operations. This combina-"}, {"title": "A. Search", "content": "To effectively resolve issues within a codebase, it is crucial to precisely identify the root of the problem, henceforth referred to as the 'relevant location'. In SuperCoder2.0, we define the 'relevant location' as belonging to one of three hierarchical levels: Method/Function, Class, or Top-Level. Top-level code encompasses elements outside any class or function, including import statements. Class-level code is contained within a class but external to its methods, while method/function-level code is encapsulated within specific methods or functions. The primary objective of the Search module is to localize the bug's residence. When identified within a method or function, the module returns the method/function name along with its start line number, facilitating disambiguation between identically named methods. Empirical observations on the SWE-Bench-Lite dataset demonstrated that accurate method localization yielded optimal results. Considering that most LLMs can generate up to 4,000 tokens in a single iteration, we posit that methods or functions adhering to best software engineering practices are likely to fall within these generation limits. Our approach implements a hierarchical search space reduction strategy, systematically narrowing down from file-level to method-level granularity. This process is executed in three distinct steps:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022 Identification of candidate files from the repository, utilizing RAG and a Repository File Level Map.\nRefinement of candidate files to the most relevant subset, employing a File Level Schematic Map.\nExtraction of 'relevant locations' within the identified files.\nEach step in this process involves a discrete LLM call. Notably, our empirical findings suggest that providing comprehensive context and posing targeted questions in a single LLM call proves more effective than an iterative, reason-action-observation based agentic approach. This observation aligns with findings from the Agentless team. The subsequent sections will elaborate on each step of this process in detail.\n1) RAG and Repository File Level Map: The initial phase involves the creation of a vector store for the codebase, facilitating the retrieval of files most pertinent to a given problem statement. This process remains largely static for a given codebase. The document structure employed for embedding and searching is detailed in Listing 1."}, {"title": "1) RAG and Repository File Level Map", "content": "The initial phase involves the creation of a vector store for the codebase, facilitating the retrieval of files most pertinent to a given problem statement. This process remains largely static for a given codebase. The document structure employed for embedding and searching is detailed in Listing 1."}, {"title": "2) File Prioritization using File Level Schematic Map", "content": "Building upon the set of candidate files identified in the previous step, this phase involves the creation of a schematic representation for each file, providing a comprehensive overview of its internal structure. This schematic representation encompasses detailed descriptions of all classes and functions within the file. The schema includes class names, contained methods, method arguments, applied decorators, and available docstrings. This abstracted representation enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain a high-level perspective of the filegroup, facilitating more accurate identification of files closely related to the problem statement. The PreAssimilation Module is then employed to further refine the search space, narrowing down the potential bug location to the top 'L' files. Notably, the value of 'L' is dynamically determined by the LLM itself, allowing for adaptive file selection based on the complexity and nature of the problem. Through extensive experimentation, we observed that in exploratory scenarios, such as when SuperCoder2.0 is tasked with creating a new feature, allowing the LLM to autonomously select relevant files yields optimal results. For the specific evaluation conducted on SWE Bench Lite, we implemented a constraint limiting 'L' to a maximum of two files. In this configuration, the PreAssimilator module returns either the single most relevant file or, in more complex cases, the two most pertinent files along with a rationale for their selection. This file and method localisation approach strikes a balance between comprehensive search and computational efficiency, enabling SuperCoder2.0 to focus on the most promising areas of the codebase while maintaining the flexibility to handle diverse problem types. The integration of LLM-driven file selection with the structured schematic representation enhances the system's ability to navigate and understand complex codebases, thereby improving its overall problem-solving capabilities."}, {"title": "3) Localization of 'Relevant Locations'", "content": "Following the identification of the top 'L' files in the preceding steps, the process advances to pinpointing specific areas within these files where modifications are required. This task is accomplished through the deployment of the CoderParser Module, a sophisticated component designed to analyze the problem statement in conjunction with the entire file content. The CoderParser Module performs a comprehensive analysis, outputting both the precise location and a detailed plan for necessary code alterations. The full specifications of this process are delineated in Appendix 1c. Our approach categorizes potential code changes into three distinct hierarchical levels:\n\u2022 Top-Level code modifications\n\u2022 Method or Function level alterations\n\u2022 Class-Level adjustments\nThis stratified approach was developed in response to empirical observations revealing that line-level edits frequently resulted in linting issues, particularly in languages with strict indentation requirements such as Python. Consequently, we adopted a strategy of high-level code replacement, focusing on class-level or method-level modifications generated by the LLM. For top-level code changes, the LLM is instructed to specify start and end line numbers delineating the section requiring modification. This demarcated code segment is then replaced in its entirety. This methodology ensures the maintenance of code structure and integrity while allowing for comprehensive modifications. It mitigates potential syntax errors and maintains consistency with the existing codebase architecture. The specific implementation details of this editing process are elaborated upon in the subsequent Edit section. By employing this hierarchical, structure-aware approach to code modification, SuperCoder2.0 achieves a balance between granular problem-solving and preservation of overall code quality and consistency. This method enhances the system's ability to implement complex changes while minimizing unintended side effects or structural disruptions to the codebase."}, {"title": "B. Code Modification and Insertion", "content": "The Code Modification and Insertion module is responsible for implementing the actual code changes as determined by the preceding analysis. This module operates based on the action plan provided by the CodeParser module, processing each plan element sequentially. The module receives relevant class or method information, or in the case of top-level code modifications, it obtains the code segment defined by pre-determined start and end lines. The module's architecture comprises two primary components:\n\u2022 CodeGeneration Module\n\u2022 CodeEditing Module\nThe CodeGeneration Module leverages advanced LLMs to generate new or modified code segments based on the provided action plan and context. In contrast, the CodeEditing Module operates independently of LLMs, utilizing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) library in Python for precise code manipulation. This module processes the class name, method name, or specific lines of code targeted for modification, implementing the changes as specified in the action plan. When modifications are suggested for a method, the CodeGeneration Module regenerates the entire method body. Subsequently, the CodeEditing Module replaces the original method with this newly generated code, ensuring syntactic correctness and maintaining the overall structure of the codebase. This bifurcated approach allows for a separation of concerns between code generation and code integration, enhancing the system's ability to produce contextually appropriate modifications while preserving the integrity of the existing codebase structure. The use of AST-based editing ensures that the modifications are implemented"}, {"title": "1) Code Generation and Editing Process", "content": "The code generation and editing process is initiated by invoking an LLM with inputs comprising the action plan, problem statement, and relevant code segments (class, method, or top-level code) identified in the preceding steps. This LLM invocation is executed iteratively for each plan element generated by the CodeParser module. To enhance robustness and solution diversity, we employ a multi-temperature sampling approach. For each plan, 'k' distinct LLM calls are made, each with a different temperature setting, yielding 'k' potential solutions for the given problem statement. This strategy allows for the exploration of various solution spaces, potentially uncovering more optimal or creative resolutions. The editing process is tailored to the hierarchical level of the relevant code location:\n\u2022 For class-level modifications, the entire class code is replaced with the newly generated class code using AST module.\n\u2022 For method or function-level changes, the AST module in Python is utilized to replace the entire method or function body.\n\u2022 For top-level code alterations, the LLM generates start and end line numbers, and the code within this range is substituted with the newly generated code.\nFollowing the generation of 'k' potential solutions, a comprehensive validation process is initiated. Each solution undergoes evaluation against the full suite of repository-level test cases, rather than a subset, ensuring thorough verification of code integrity and functionality. Solutions that induce failures in previously passing tests are systematically eliminated from consideration. In scenarios where multiple viable solutions remain post-validation, an additional LLM call is made. This final invocation is tasked with selecting the optimal solution based on the original problem statement and any additional context derived from the validation process. This multi-stage, temperature-varied generation and rigorous validation approach significantly enhances the reliability and effectiveness of the code modification process. By leveraging both divergent solution generation and convergent solution selection, SuperCoder2.0 maximizes its potential to produce high-quality, contextually appropriate code modifications while minimizing the risk of introducing new errors or regressions."}, {"title": "C. Iterative Feedback and Refinement Mechanism", "content": "SuperCoder2.0 incorporates a sophisticated feedback and refinement mechanism to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of generated code solutions. This process is structured as follows:\n\u2022 Pre-Application Baseline: Prior to the application of any generated code, a comprehensive execution of all repository-level test cases is conducted. The results, including both passed and failed tests, are meticulously recorded to establish a baseline performance metric.\n\u2022 Post-Application Evaluation: Following the implementation of each generated solution, the entire suite of repository-level test cases is re-executed. This step is crucial for identifying any newly introduced failures or regressions.\n\u2022 Feedback Loop Activation: In the event that new test case failures are detected, a feedback loop is initiated. This loop triggers the CodeGeneration module to refine the specific solution that induced the failure. Notably, this refinement process is targeted and does not involve the generation of multiple candidate solutions through temperature sweeps, as in the initial generation phase.\n\u2022 Iterative Refinement: The feedback and refinement process is applied iteratively to each potential solution. While the system is designed to support multiple iterations of this process for each solution, we have implemented a constraint limiting it to a single iteration to optimize token usage and computational efficiency.\n\u2022 Contextual Information Provision: The feedback loop supplies the CodeGeneration LLM with detailed information about the failed test case, including the relevant code segment and the original problem statement.

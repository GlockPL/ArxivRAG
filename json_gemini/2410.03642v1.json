While previous research focuses on general alignment to principles such as helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty, the need to account for individual and diverse preferences has been largely overlooked, potentially undermining customized human experiences. To address this gap, we train LLMs that can \"interact to align\", essentially cultivating the meta-skill of LLMs to implicitly infer the unspoken personalized preferences of the current user through multi-turn conversations, and then dynamically align their following behaviors and responses to these inferred preferences. Our approach involves establishing a diverse pool of 3,310 distinct user personas by initially creating seed examples, which are then expanded through iterative self-generation and filtering. Guided by distinct user personas, we leverage multi-LLM collaboration to develop a multi-turn preference dataset containing 3K+ multi-turn conversations in tree structures. Finally, we apply supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs using this dataset. For evaluation, we establish the ALOE (ALign with customized prEferences) benchmark, consisting of 100 carefully selected examples and well-designed metrics to measure the customized alignment performance during conversations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling dynamic, personalized alignment via interaction.", "sections": [{"title": "Introduction", "content": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) enables them to perform complex language tasks (Nakano et al., 2021; Achiam et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b; Qian et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024e). As their capabilities develop, ensuring their alignment with human values and preferences becomes increasingly important (Ji et al., 2023; Houben et al., 2022). Previous research on LLMs alignment largely focuses on training models to adhere to broad, generalized human preferences, such as being helpful, harmless, and honest (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). While these principles provide a solid foundation to control the LLMs' behaviors, they frequently overlook the diverse ways individual users interact with and expect outcomes from these models. LLMs' ability to accommodate diverse preferences, especially from minority groups, is crucial yet under-explored for enhancing conversational experiences and fostering inclusivity across demographics (Mehrabi et al., 2021; Fung et al., 2024).\nA significant challenge lies in shifting from a one-size-fits-all approach to effectively addressing the complexities of human-LLM interactions (Wang et al., 2024d). To address this, we propose training LLMs to align with individual preferences through interactions. Specifically, our goal is to cultivate the ability of LLMs to infer users' implicit preferences and tailor their following responses accordingly, rather than rigidly following generalized behavioral rules. As illustrated in Figure 1, starting from the second round of conversation, the model can implicitly infer essential aspects of the user's persona, including their extroverted and lively nature, city living in, artistic background, and role as a parent. This allows it to better anticipate the user's preferences, such as a preference for vibrant conversation, discussion about art, and expected mention about their daughter. As a result, the model can tailor its responses by incorporating emojis and dynamic language, recommending art exhibitions, and inquiring further details about the user's daughter. With each subsequent round, the model refines its understanding of the user's persona, leading to increasing alignment levels and more customized responses.\nTo achieve this, we introduce a scalable training approach that starts by automatically creating diverse user personas, as existing persona databases (Zhang, 2018; Chan et al., 2024) lack details needed for guiding long conversations. Specifically, we include profile and personality pools to guide conversation topics and communication styles respectively for more accurate control. The pool is built iteratively through a self-generation and filtering process, beginning with manually crafted seed examples. In each iteration, a subset of examples is randomly selected and combined with a generation prompt for the off-the-shelf LLM (GPT-4o) to produce a new batch of examples. We measure the semantic similarity between the new and existing examples to decide whether to include or discard them. Through this process, we construct a diverse pool of 3,310 distinct and diverse personas.\nBased on the constructed persona pool, we establish a preference dataset using a tree-structured, multi-turn conversational format (see Figure 3), implemented within a multi-LLM collaboration framework with four distinct LLMs, each assigned specific roles. In each iteration, one persona description is randomly sampled from the pool, with a designated role-playing LLM to simulate the user to initiate the conversation. For each conversational round, an induction LLM identifies which aspects of the persona have been revealed based further on previous conversations and the complete persona description. Two additional LLMs then contribute to generating the pairwise responses: the rejected LLM provides a direct response to the role-playing LLM's message, while the preferred LLM generates a personalized reply based on the extracted persona traits. One of these responses is randomly selected for the role-playing LLM to continue the conversation. This process enables the creation of a preference dataset with 3K+ multi-turn conversation samples in tree structures, which is utilized through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for effective model training."}, {"title": "Approach", "content": "In this section, we present our scalable method for constructing tree-structured multi-turn preference data and describe how the resulting dataset is utilized for training.

These personas then guide conversations, resulting in a multi-turn preference dataset comprising over 3K multi-turn conversations."}, {"title": "Training", "content": "Employing the constructed preference dataset, we fine-tune multiple LLMs following the training recipe described below.\nWe first implement supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to reach a decent initial-ization following Ouyang et al. (2022). In this stage, we train LLMs only on the preferred re-sponse with the training objective:\n$L_{SFT} = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\sum_{t=1}^{l}log P(p_i/m_i, \\{m_j, s_j\\}_{j=1}^{i-1};\\theta), (1)$\nwhere $P(p_i|m_i, \\{m_j, s_j\\}_{j=1}^{i-1}; \\theta)$ is the conditional probability of the model (parameterized by $\\theta$) gen-erating the preferred response $p_i$ given the mes-sage $m_i$, the conversations $\\{m_j, s_j\\}_{j=1}^{i-1}$ before i turn. K is the total number of interaction turns. \u03a4\u03bf maintain the model's general problem-solving and multi-turn interaction capabilities, we also mix the SFT agent data from CodeActInstruct (Wang et al., 2024b) as our training data."}, {"title": "Reinforcement Learning", "content": "To further calibrate the responses and enhance the performance, we then perform reinforcement learning (RL) using the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algo-rithm (Rafailov et al., 2024) with the pairwise pref-erence dataset we construct:\n$L_{DPO} = \\sum_{i=1}^{K} log \\sigma (\\beta . log \\frac{P_{\\theta}(p_i | m_i, s_i)}{P_{\\theta'}(p_i | m_i, s_i)} - \\beta.log\\frac{P_{\\theta}(r_i | m_i, s_i)}{P_{\\theta'}(r_i | m_i, s_i)}), (2)$\nwhere $P_{\\theta}(p_i | m_i, s_i)$ is the probability of the model (parameterized by $\\theta$) generating the preferred re-sponse $p_i$ given the message $m_i$ and state $s_i$, $P_{\\theta}(r_i | m_i, s_i)$ is the probability of the model gener-ating the rejected response $r_i$, $\\theta'$ denotes the refer-ence model, $\\sigma(\u00b7)$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\beta$ is a parameter controlling the deviation from the refer-ence model. The state $s_i$ refers to the conversations $\\{m_j, s_j\\}_{j=1}^{i-1}$ before i turn.\nFor SFT, we apply a linear learning rate scheduler with a learning rate of 1e-5, a batch size of 48, and 3 training epochs. Similarly, for DPO, we use a linear learning rate scheduler with a learning rate of 1e-5, $\\beta$ set to 0.9, a batch size of 48, and 1 training epoch."}, {"title": "Benchmark", "content": "To quantify the effectiveness of current mainstream LLMs to align with customized human prefer-ences during interactive conversations, we develop a benchmark consisting of 100 carefully curated instances and well-designed metrics for evaluation.

The selected LLMs include Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024a), Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (Jiang et al., 2023), and OLMo-7B-Instruct (Groeneveld et al., 2024)."}, {"title": "Results", "content": "The main experimental results are shown in Table 1. Among the evaluated open-source LLMs (Base), Qwen2 outperforms others, achieving the highest average AL of 4.67 across all conversation turns, along with the highest IR, with a regression coefficient (slope) of 0.254 and an $R^2$ of 0.917. These metrics indicate that Qwen2 not only generates superior responses in each turn but also effectively infers and extracts user information and preferences over the course of conversations, highlighting its strong capacity for alignment through interaction. In contrast, the other three LLMs demonstrate an average AL below 3 and IR under 0.01, underscoring a notable gap in current LLMs' capacity to dynamically adjust to individual preferences. This is due to the fact that standard training methods for LLMs focus primarily on general alignment principles, neglecting the significance of multi-turn interactions between humans and LLMs.\nWe also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach (Ours). We observe that all four models exhibit significant improvements in both average AL and IR compared to the Base LLMs. An exception is Qwen2, where our approach shows a slight lag compared to the Base LLM in terms of IR. We attribute this to our model reaching near-perfect alignment at later interaction turns (i.e., AL=4.98 when K>7), leaving little room for further improvement and resulting in lower IR. Otherwise, our approach is generally applicable, evidenced by an average relative improvement of 32.0% on average AL. To facilitate easier interpretation and comparison, we visualize the AL across 10 conversation turns before and after applying our approach to four LLMs in Figure 4. LLMs tuned using our approach generally increase the AL for each turn and reach a larger improvement rate, evidenced by a steeper positive linear regression fitting line in a much higher position."}, {"title": "Further Analysis", "content": ""}, {"title": "Effectiveness of Using Pairwise Responses via Reinforcement Learning", "content": "We compare LLMs' performance when further trained using both preferred and pairwise response pairs via RL against training only on preferred re-sponses using SFT.

Specifically, we fine-tune LLMs using SFT on preferred and rejected responses separately (i.e., SFT-Preferred vs. SFT-Rejected). As shown in Table 1, the performance consistently diverged across all models, with a relative difference exceed-ing 10.97%, consistently favoring SFT-Preferred. This demonstrates that the preferred responses are significantly better, offering distinct pairs suitable for high-quality RL training."}, {"title": "The Influence of Agent Data", "content": "We investigate the influence of incorporating the agent data from CodeActInstruct during the SFT stage.

As shown in Table 2, the agent data-consisting of multi-turn interactions with the environment-contributes to the interaction ca-pabilities of LLMs, achieving the highest IR. The preferred responses in ALOE optimize LLMs for conversational domains, enhancing their fundamen-tal capabilities to alignment via interaction in this context, evidenced by the significant improvement on average AL."}, {"title": "Human Annotation", "content": "To measure the reliability of using GPT-40 for au-tomatic evaluation, we conduct human annotation for verification.

However, the expanding capabilities of LLMs also heighten risks, as recent research highlights certain undesirable behaviors in these models (e.g., leaking proprietary information (Finlayson et al., 2024), jailbreaking attack (Paulus et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023), overshadowed knowledge (Zhang et al., 2024c), failed knowledge update (Qin et al., 2024a), situation awareness (Laine et al., 2024)). Thus, aligning LLMs with human intent is essential for ensuring their responses are helpful, honest, and harmless, which is key to building trustworthy AI and maintaining control over its development (Ouyang et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2023; Cao et al., 2024). The typical approach to aligning LLMs, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), begins with gathering a dataset that captures general human preferences (Wang et al., 2024f; Zheng et al., 2024a; Lin et al., 2024; Xiong et al., 2024a,b; Wang et al., 2024g), either through human annotation (Ouyang et al., 2022) or generation by advanced LLMs (Cui et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022). This dataset is subsequently used for training a reward model (Leike et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2024b). Follow-ing reward modeling, LLMs are fine-tuned through reinforcement learning (e.g., proximal policy op-timization (Schulman et al., 2017) to better align their outputs with human preferences)."}, {"title": "LLMs Interaction", "content": "LLMs exhibit the significant potential to interact smoothly with human users during inference (Wang et al., 2023b).

It may also mask the model's shortcomings in aligning with individual preferences during deeper interactions.

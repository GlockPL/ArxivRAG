Metaxas", "Anh Tran"], "abstract": "We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs.

The core idea behind diffusion models is to learn how to reverse the diffusion process by gradually transforming a simple initial distribution, like Gaussian noise, into a complex data distribution. The flexibility, robust performance, and high-quality outputs make them powerful tools for advancing the state-of-the-art in generative modeling, and large diffusion-based generators have revolutionized the field of image [51, 3], video [23, 21], and 3D synthesis [50, 62, 61]. While diffusion models initially rely on UNet architectures, recent methods have shifted gear to build upon transformer backbones. A line of works [48, 14, 11] have shown that transformer-based diffusion models are scalable and consistently offer higher generation quality\nEqual contributions.\n+Work done while at VinAI.\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)."}, {"title": "Related Work", "content": "2.1 State Space Models and Their Applications in Vision Tasks\nIn control engineering and system identification, state space models (SSMs) are described by state variables and first-order differential equations but initially underperformed in deep learning. Recent enhancements, notably by S4 [18] through the use of a HiPPO [16] initialization matrix, have significantly improved SSMs. Subsequent studies [18, 15, 17, 35, 1] show that SSMs can match transformers in long-range sequence modeling with the added benefit of linear time and space complexities. Notably, Mamba [15] has advanced over transformers in NLP by using a time-varying system with context-dependent parameters, enhancing the differentiation of hidden states over long sequences. This positions Mamba as a strong alternative to transformers across various domains.\nIn computer vision, ViM and VMamba [74, 41] are the first works to introduce Mamba as a building block in discriminative tasks. Sequentially, Mamba is explored in many computer vision tasks such as medical imaging [43, 39], point clouds [70, 34], and image generation [25, 73]. Similar to vision transformers, images are divided into patches, and the patches are mapped into tokens. The tokens are then arranged in a sequence following a scanning order. In vision transformers, the scanning order does not matter since attention scores are computed between every token pair. However, SSMs consider the order information, introducing an inductive bias about 2D images into the model. Therefore, scanning order is vital in setting vision models' performance. ViM [74] proposed a bidirectional scanning order (sweep-2) for discriminative tasks. VMamba [41] proposed cross-scanning (sweep-4) per each Mamba building block. This cross-scan improves the model performance but costs enormous overhead. MambaND [33] reduces that cost by introducing two methods: interleaved scanning and multi-head scanning. Interleaved scanning, which alternates the scanning order in the sequential blocks, is simpler but gains better performance in discriminative tasks. Recently, Zigma [25] proposed a zigzag-8 scanning order to preserve the locality property (i.e., each token is adjacent to its next and previous tokens). The zigzag-8 scanning order shows faster convergence compared to the bidirectional one. In this paper, we show that too many scanning orders, e.g., sweep-8 and zigzag-8, may introduce excessive information and lead to worse performance than sweep-4. Instead, sweep-4 offers the best performance (Section 4.4).\n2.2 Diffusion Architecture\nDiffusion models [22, 57, 56, 51] are an emerging type of generative model that requires a sequential denoising process of several to thousands of steps to sample an image from initial Gaussian noise. Notably, most of them are based on Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) that require an accumulation of additional stochastic noise at each generation step. Alternatively, there is a line of flow matching methods [36, 40, 44, 5] that emphasize deterministic trajectories from pure Gaussian noise to the target data distribution, favoring a straighter solution path. Their applications span across different tasks like image super-resolution [13], depth estimation [19], and motion synthesis [26]. Recent works [44, 31] have proved that diffusion models and flow matching are strongly correlated and can be converted into each other. In this work, we only focus on the simple objective of flow matching for our design.\nMeanwhile, most methods are originally based on Unet architecture, which utilizes convolution\nresblock to capture local information at multiscale resolution. The attention layer is also used, interleaving between resblock layers to capture global information. Recently, the vision transformer [9, 42] has emerged and largely surpassed CNNs in many tasks. For diffusion image modeling, several transformer-based architectures [48, 2, 14] have been recently introduced. Transformer-based architectures capture global information better than Unet ones and can generate higher-quality images. Specifically, UViT [2] replaced convolution resblock layers with transformer blocks and removed downsampling/upsampling blocks. DiT [48] directly replaced Unet with a vision transformer. Inspired by this, MDT [14] and MaskDiT [72] introduced a mask latent modeling approach to better capture contextual information and enhance training efficiency. Although transformer architectures achieve better image generation, these models suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity, slowing down training and inference processes. Recently, with the birth of Flash Attention [8, 7], both training and inference time of these transformer-based models are significantly reduced thanks to\ntresidual block is a skip-connection block that learns residual functions with respected to the layer inputs."}, {"title": "Frequency-based networks", "content": "Employing frequency components extracted by Fourier, Cosine, or Wavelet transform in solving vision tasks was common in classical computer vision. Many modern works still find this practice useful in improving the performance of deep neural networks. In perception tasks, several works [37, 38, 67] integrate frequency processing in transformer architecture. NomMer [37] applied a discrete cosine transformer into global attention to efficiently yield synergistic context from both global and local contexts. To improve Masked Image Modeling, Ge-AE [38] introduces an additional frequency decoder using Fourier transform to reconstruct the high-frequency information better. Wave-Vit [67] applies wavelet into self-attention modules to reduce the time and space complexity of the transformer architecture while still preserving the performance. Recent work Simba [47] introduced Fourier-based layers (EinFFT) in combination with Mamba block to replace MLP layers for better channel mixing. To solve the image denoising problem, FreqMamba [71] applied a wavelet and Fourier transformer to process features injected into the Mamba block. In generative modeling, several works [66, 49, 69] corporate wavelet frequencies into generative framework. By explicitly decomposing features/images into high- and low-frequency bands through wavelet transform, the generative model can train stably and converge faster. Furthermore, the high frequencies can be learned more efficiently, leading to a sharper synthesis image. Observing the benefit of wavelet processing in generative modeling, we apply discrete wavelet transform on local features before feeding into the Mamba layers. By using cross-attention to fuse wavelet frequency features and spatial features, our method achieves significant improvement in image synthesis compared to merely spatial feature processing."}, {"title": "Method", "content": "This section presents DiMSUM, a novel architecture aiming for effective and high-quality image synthesis. Preliminary knowledge will be provided in section 3.1, then overview structure and mechanism of the proposed network (section 3.2), and finally its core components (sections 3.3 and 3.4).\n3.1 Preliminary\nState Space Model (SSM). SSM is a new type of sequence model that uses an implicit hidden state h(t) \u2208 RN\u00d7L to map the 1D input signal x(t) \u2208 RL to its corresponding output signal y(t) \u2208 RL.

In other words, the constant parameters (\u0392, C, \u2206) are tuned into input-dependent parameters, enforcing the context awareness of input sequence states:\nBt = Linear N (xt), Ct = Linearn (xt), At = Softplus(Broadcast\u2081(Linear1(xt))),\nwhere Linear* (.) is a projection layer to *-dimensional vector, Softplus(.) = log(1 + exp(.)), and Broadcast (.) means duplicating a single-value vector to L-dimensional vector.\nDiffusion model. Diffusion models [55, 22, 57, 58, 51] are also known as score-based models that learn the transitional trajectories from a Gaussian noise to signals in the target domain. Most methods are based on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), requiring a larger number of function evaluations to generate an image. Recently, Flow matching [36, 40, 5, 44] has proved to be a promising method that finds a deterministic mapping between input Gaussian noise and input data via solving Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Given an input data x belonging to the modeling distribution p(x) and a random noise \u20ac \u2208 N (0, I), the forward process is formulated as:\nXt = XXt + \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4,\nwhere xt is the noise-added data at a time step t \u2208 [0, 1] and (at, ot) are time-dependent functions of t. Particularly, these functions are constrained such that a\u2081 = \u03c3\u03bf = 0 and 00 = 0\u2081 = 1 to produce correct mapping between data x at t = 0 and noise e at t = 1. Specifically, [36, 40, 5] use a simple linear function where at = 1 \u2212 t and ot = t. We employ Flow matching's training objective to estimate the velocity between noise e and data x:\n0 = argmin Et,xt [||X1 \u2212 X0 vo (xt, C, t)||],\nwhere ve is a velocity estimator implemented by a neural network with parameters @ and c is an input condition (e.g., class or text). If no condition is used, c is set to empty.\nWavelet transformation. Among frequency transform techniques, wavelet transform stands out for its simplicity and efficiency. It preserves the structure of image space, with low-frequency subbands representing down-sampled approximations of the input image, while high-frequency ones emphasize local details such as vertical, horizontal, and diagonal edges. Particularly, Haar feature is the most prevalent wavelet transform, consisting of a low-pass filter L = [11] and a high-pass filter H = [-1_1]. To decompose an image x \u2208 RH\u00d7W, it needs to construct 4 kernels LLT, LHT, HLT, HHT, then applies them to the input image to extract corresponding subbands {XLL,XLH,XHL,XHH |X* \u2208 RH/2\u00d7W/2}, respectively. This process is called discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Notably, these filters are pairwise orthogonal, so an invertible matrix exists to map the data back to the original image space, coined as discrete inverse wavelet transform (IDWT). Given its benefits, we propose to use wavelet transform to supplement the local structure of frequency components into the process of Mamba, thus leading to enhanced image quality and training convergence, as demonstrated through our empirical experiments in section 4."}, {"title": "DiM block", "content": "A core component of our approach is the DiM block that relies on a novel Spatial-Frequency Mamba fusion technique. In this section, we will discuss in detail the ideas behind this vital component.\nScanning in frequency space. Mamba-based approaches in diffusion models often lack effective scanning schemes for preserving both local and global 2D spatial information. Although several works have proposed different heuristic scanning methods [74, 41, 33, 25] to address this issue, these approaches are insufficient for capturing local pixel dependencies and long-range frequency relationships. Though LocalMamba [28] proposed a window scanning to mimic the convolution kernel, it often underperforms compared to previously mentioned scanning methods as it is limited to the dependencies of nearby-pixels within window.\nDIMSUM addresses these challenges by decomposing the original image into frequency wavelet subbands. This approach is effective to capture long-range frequency while preserving relations across different subbands. We redesigned the window scanning, where each window corresponds to a subband of the frequency space as in Fig. 3. Consequently, each window captures the full range of low/high-frequency signals from the original image. This advantage sets us apart from traditional window scanning in image space. As the model progresses through different subbands, it incorporates spatial information represented at various low-to-high frequencies, adding valuable context to the denoising process.\nWavelet Mamba. We now examine the integration of the wavelet transform into the Mamba structure shown in Fig. 2. Wavelet Mamba first applies DWT to decompose input features into wavelet subbands. Our main setting uses two-level Haar wavelet to map input into low and high-frequency features. Given input feature x \u2208 RC\u00d7H\u00d7W, first-level wavelet transform is applied to produce 4 wavelet subbands of size RC\u00d7H/2\u00d7W/2.

Motivated by Zamba [1], we introduce the globally-shared transformer (attention) block. This shared attention block is added after each of four DiM blocks as shown in Fig. 1 since we want to preserve the continuity of the 4-sweep alternative scanning order. By using shared weights, we significantly reduce the number of parameters introduced by different attention blocks. This layer complements the flow of Mamba since transformers excel at extracting global relations without relying on manually defined orders of input sequences, as in Mamba. Hence, with this hybrid architecture, our method effectively addresses Mamba's order dependence while significantly reducing the FID with very few additional parameters."}, {"title": "Experiments", "content": "Implementation.

For the starting baseline, we adopt the same training settings from Zigma[25]. We choose sweep-4 with interleave scanning order [33] by default. In Fig. 2a, with our proposed conditional Mamba, the FID score is improved from 6.19 to 5.27, and the same trend is observed for recall. Meanwhile, adding Wavelet Mamba followed by a simple concatenation layer to combine spatial and wavelet features results in a worse score of 5.87 due to the weak alignment between these features. This demonstrates that our proposed cross-attention fusion layer is crucial for performance improvement, fully leveraging wavelet components to achieve a score boosted to 4.92. The performance is further enhanced to 4.66 by incorporating the weight-shared transformer block.\nDesign choices of fusion layer.

By leveraging wavelet transform within the Mamba framework, our method enhances local structure awareness and ensures efficient spatial and frequency information fusion.

Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DiMSUM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks, achieving lower FID scores and higher recall metrics, highlighting its ability to produce diverse and high-fidelity images. The proposed cross-attention fusion layer and globally shared transformer block also contribute to the model's robustness and scalability. Considering the promising results, we anticipate that future research in related domains, such as text-to-image synthesis, will adapt our backbone architecture and achieve comparable improvements in performance.\nSocial impact and limitation. We believe that our proposed network advances the architectural design of state-space models for image generation. This model can be extended to various tasks, such as large-scale text-to-image generation and multimodal diffusion. While there is a risk that our architecture could be misused for malicious purposes, posing a social security challenge, we are confident that this risk can be mitigated with the recent development of security-related research. Hence, the positives can outweigh the negatives, rendering the concern minor.\nWhile our method outperforms other diffusion baselines in generation quality and training convergence, we acknowledge areas for improvement. These include designing a multiscale architecture and addressing manually defined scanning orders. Another advanced technique, such as masking training regularization [14, 72], is orthogonal to our approach and could lead to further improvements."}]}

INTRODUCTION", "content": "Charismatic leadership is a powerful force influencing human behavior. Consequently, its significance has been a major area of study in psychology, sociology, and management for decades [1]. Charisma, defined as \u201cvalues-based, symbolic, and emotion-laden leader signaling\" [2, p. 304], where signals are defined as \"things one does that are visible and that are in part designed to communicate\" [3, p. 434], is an essential quality that enables leaders to exert their influence effectively. The essence of charismatic leadership lies in the ability of charismatic individuals to build strong connections with their followers. To achieve this connection, they utilize charisma signals to convey their leadership abilities [4], express their values [5], [6], and demonstrate their understanding of right and wrong [2]. Leaders such as former U.S. President George W. Bush and former French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande amplified their charisma following the 9/11 attacks and the Paris terror attacks, indicating that leaders' charisma signaling significantly increases in response to crises [5], [7]. Previous studies have shown that the effect of charismatic leadership can lead to a range of positive outcomes, such as enhanced follower productivity [8], increased influence on social media [9], and improved adherence to stay-at-home orders during COVID-19, which significantly reduced infection rates and COVID-related death rates [10]. In this context, charismatic leadership tactics (CLTs), which relate to signaling devices for measuring charisma, play a crucial role in understanding and quantifying the phenomenon of charismatic leadership [11]. Until now, conducting these studies has been labor-intensive, as all texts for the analysis of charismatic verbal tactics had to be coded manually, because there was no open-"}, {"title": "II. RELATED WORKS", "content": "In recent years, NLP techniques have emerged as promising tools for analyzing and understanding charismatic leadership [13]. NLP can be used to automatically extract linguistic features from speeches and identify patterns that determine the level of charisma in a text, ultimately aiding in distinguishing charismatic leaders from non-charismatic ones. [13]-[15]. For instance, researchers have utilized machine learning algorithms to classify political speeches based on their charismatic content and found that certain linguistic features, such as enthusiasm, optimism, and rhetorical devices, are more prevalent in charismatic speeches [14]. Another study employed deep learning techniques to analyze the emotional tone of political speeches and demonstrated that charismatic leaders tend to use more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions than non-charismatic leaders [15]. The advent of transformer-based models, such as BERT, has further advanced the field of NLP by providing robust representations of text data that can capture subtle nuances in language usage [12], [16]. In particular, researchers have fine-tuned pre-trained language models like BERT to classify texts according to their sentiment, emotion, and persuasive appeal [16]. Building upon this work, we aim to develop a BERT-based model that can accurately detect CLTs in sentences modeled after gubernatorial speeches. Our approach will leverage a large corpus of AI generated sentences modelled after gubernatorial speeches. By training our model on this dataset, we hope to provide insights into how charismatic leadership manifests in spoken language and whether such manifestations vary across different contexts or leader types. In the exploration of ethical leadership, recent literature has critically examined prevailing concepts and advanced new perspectives to enhance our understanding of leadership behaviors. Two notable contributions in this domain shed light on ELS, addressing inherent limitations and proposing innovative frameworks. A previous study critically evaluated the current landscape of ethical leadership [17]. By identifying conceptual conflation and a dearth of knowledge regarding causes and consequences, the authors propose a refined conceptualization based on signaling theory. Ethical leadership behavior is defined as the signaling behavior of leaders towards stakeholders, which includes the enactment of prosocial values and the expression of moral emotions [17]. This work lays the groundwork for a clearer and more precise understanding of ethical leadership, urging future investigations into theoretical models and methodological advancements. Complementing this, Banks et al. [18] used a multifaceted approach to delve into ELSs through signaling theory. Utilizing a combination of constant comparative analysis, preregistered experiments, and data science techniques, the research identifies verbal ELSs associated with emotions such as righteous anger and pride. The study demonstrates the impact of ELSs on evaluations of ethical leadership and delves into their influence on countering counterproductive behavior, enhancing task performance, and encouraging extra role behavior. A noteworthy contribution is the introduction of DeepEthics, a machine learning algorithm designed to automatically score texts for ELSs, offering a practical tool for future research endeavors. These works collectively emphasize the importance of ELSs in various contexts, including the COVID-19 pandemic and social justice movements. As [2] in their work on charismatic leadership, they argue for a nuanced distinction between leader behaviors and subjective follower evaluations, urging scholars to adopt clearer conceptualizations and innovative methodologies in the ongoing exploration of ELSs. As the field progresses, these contributions serve as valuable guides for researchers seeking to deepen their understanding of the complex dynamics between leaders and their stakeholders in the realm of ethical leadership."}, {"title": "III. DATASET DESCRIPTION", "content": "In this section we describe the contents of the dataset and explain its generation by using Large Language Models (LLMS)"}, {"title": "A. Content of the dataset", "content": "Charismatic leaders often achieve significantly better objective and subjective outcomes in their leadership roles [11]. For this reason, most people mention charismatic leaders like Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., or Barack Obama when asked about exemplary leaders. In this signaling process, the charismatic effect is operationalized through twelve CLTS, which consist of three major components: frame, delivery and substance [11]. Framing CLTs include the use of metaphors, stories, anecdotes, rhetorical questions, contrasts, and three-part lists, all demonstrating an individual's ability to persuade and effectively utilize figures of speech [11]. Charismatic leaders also convey their message through nonverbal behaviors, the delivery CLTs, which are the physical presentation of the signal accompanying the verbal message. Delivery CLTS encompass body gestures, facial expressions, and an animated tone of voice [11]. The substance CLTs form the foundation of charismatic leadership. They establish a connection between the leader's message and the followers' needs while clarifying the leader's goals and motivations. This clarity enables followers to trust these powerful signals as they exert effort. Substance CLTs are moral convictions, the expression of the sentiments of the collective, setting high and ambitious goals, and the leaders' confidence in the achievement of these goals [11]. Taken together, CLTs enable leaders to signal their ability and willingness to lead and convince individuals to follow them willingly. Since charisma is a strong predictor of positive leadership outcomes, signaling charisma can evoke followers' previous positive experiences with charismatic leaders."}, {"title": "B.

METHODS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP", "content": "In the domain of multilabel sentence classification for natural language, the BERT algorithm has demonstrated efficacy owing to its advanced capabilities in NLP. BERT, a transformer-based model, has redefined various NLP tasks, including sentence classification, by leveraging bidirectional context understanding and capturing intricate dependencies within textual data. The foundational mechanism of BERT lies in its pre-training phase, during which it is exposed to vast amounts of unlabeled text data. Through unsupervised learning, BERT learns to predict masked words within sentences, leveraging bidirectional contextual information. This enables BERT to develop a deep understanding of language nuances, making it adept at capturing the intricacies of context and semantic relationships, forming a robust foundation for subsequent tasks such as sentence classification. In the context of multilabel sentence classification for CLTs, BERT is applied to represent sentences or phrases as embeddings in a high-dimensional vector space. Through tokenization and contextualized embeddings, BERT transforms each word into a vector representation. These vectors are then combined to create contextualized embeddings for the entire sentence, encapsulating the nuanced meaning and context. The multilabel nature of the task involves predicting multiple labels or categories for a given sentence, aligning with the diverse dimensions inherent in CLTs. The code and further materials used to implement our methods and experimental setup is publicly available on GitHub The data containing in total 124776 sentences is split into training and test data with 80% used for finetuning the BERT model and 20% for evaluating the models"}, {"title": "V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "content": "The multilabel classification task is evaluated with a test dataset that was split from the corpus. The evaluation results are quantized via standard machine learning metrics like accuracy, precision and f1-score.

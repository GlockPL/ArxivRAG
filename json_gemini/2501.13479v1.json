Unlike traditional paradigms that depend on large-scale annotated datasets, FSL allows models to generalize effectively from only a few examples. This capability is particularly crucial in domains where data collection and annotation are expensive or infeasible, such as rare disease diagnosis in healthcare, language processing for low-resource languages, and robotic task adaptation in dynamic environments.\nDespite its potential, FSL faces several critical challenges that limit its scalability and adoption in real-world applications. A key issue is sensitivity to randomness, where model performance is highly variable due to random initialization or sampling strategies. This inconsistency complicates reproducibility and hinders the development of reliable benchmarks. Another major challenge is domain adaptation, as FSL models often fail to generalize effectively when source and target domains have significant differences in data distributions or class representations. This limitation is particularly problematic in scenarios such as medical imaging, where population-level variations in data can drastically affect model performance. Additionally, robustness to noisy data remains a significant obstacle, with real-world datasets often contaminated by mislabeled or outlier examples that degrade model accuracy, especially in high-stakes domains like finance and autonomous systems.\nTo address these challenges holistically, this paper introduces the Adaptive Few-Shot Learning (AFSL) framework.

In this work, we rigorously analyze the stability, robustness, and convergence of PC through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We show that, first, PC is Lyapunov stable under mild assumptions on its loss and residual energy functions, which implies intrinsic robustness to small random perturbations due to its well-defined energy-minimizing dynamics. Second, we formally establish that the PC updates approximate quasi-Newton methods by incorporating higher-order curvature information, which makes them more stable and able to converge with fewer iterations compared to models trained via backpropagation (BP). Furthermore, using this dynamical framework, we provide new theoretical bounds on the similarity between PC and other algorithms, i.e., BP and target propagation (TP), by precisely characterizing the role of higher-order derivatives. These bounds, derived through detailed analysis of the Hessian structures, show that PC is significantly closer to quasi-Newton updates than TP, providing a deeper understanding of the stability and efficiency of PC compared to conventional learning methods.", "sections": [{"title": "1 Introduction", "content": "The successes of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade have been primarily driven by deep learning, which has become a cornerstone in modern machine learning. Despite these remarkable achievements, there has been a resurgence of interest in exploring alternative paradigms for training neural networks [1, 2]. This renewed interest stems from the inherent limitations of standard backpropagation-based training (BP) [3], such as high computational overhead, energy inefficiency, and biological implausibility [4, 5]. As a result, there has been a revival of energy-based learning methods that were initially popularized in the 1980s, such as Hopfield networks [6], equilibrium propagation [7], contrastive Hebbian learning [8], and predictive coding [9]. These models, which minimize a general energy functional [5], employ local update rules that are well-suited for both spiking neural networks [10, 11] and neuromorphic hardware implementations [12].\nAmong these approaches, predictive coding (PC) stands out due to its intriguing theoretical properties and practical performance. Originally developed to model hierarchical information processing in the neocortex [13, 14], PC has shown remarkable performance in a wide range of machine learning tasks, such as image classification and generation [15, 16], continual learning [17], associative memory formation [18, 19], and reinforcement learning [20]. In addition to its practical applications, recent work has focused on analyzing PC from a theoretical standpoint, examining its stability and robustness properties [21, 22]. Prior investigations have drawn parallels between PC and other learning frameworks, such as BP and target propagation, but have not provided rigorous and tight bounds on the stability and robustness of PC's updates [23, 24]. Existing bounds are often based on first-order approximations [25], overlooking the impact of higher-order derivatives, which are crucial for understanding stability in non-linear systems."}, {"title": "2 Background and Motivation", "content": "Predictive coding networks (PCNs) are hierarchical neural networks, structurally similar to multi-layer perceptrons, that perform approximate Bayesian inference and adapt parameters by minimizing a variational free energy functional [33, 9, 13]. A PCN consists of L layers with neural activities {x0,x1,...,XL}, where 10 and XL correspond to the input and output signal, respectively. The goal of each layer is to predict the neural activities of the next layer via the parametric function f(W\u0131x\u0131\u22121), where W\u012b is a weight matrix that represents a linear map, and f is a nonlinear activation function. The difference between the predicted and actual neural activities is referred to as the prediction error, formally defined and denoted as \u03b5\u03b9 = x\u03b9 \u2212 f(W\u0131x\u0131\u22121). During model training, the goal of a PCN is to minimize the total summation of (squared) prediction errors, expressed via the following variational free energy:\n$$F = \\sum_{l=0}^{L} E_l = \\sum_{l=0}^{L} |\\epsilon_l|^2,$$\nwhere E\u03b9 = |\u03b5\u03b9|2 represents the local energy at neuronal layer l. This decomposition in terms of layer-wise energy functionals is what allows every update to be performed using local information only (i.e., only pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neural activity values), regardless of the fact that the updates rely on gradients. In supervised learning, the input layer xo is clamped to the data d whereas the output layer XL is clamped to the target T. The free energy then decomposes into the loss at the output layer and the residual energy of hidden layers:\n$$F = L + E, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad L = E_L = |\\epsilon_L|^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E = \\sum_{l=1}^{L-1} E_l.$$\nMinimizing the free energy functional F in PCNs is then accomplished through two distinct phases: inference and learning. During the inference phase, the activations of the hidden neuronal layers, denoted by x1,..., XL-1, are iteratively updated so as to minimize F, while the activation values at the input layer 20 and output layer XL are held fixed to the values of the input data and target output, respectively. The dynamics governing the inference updates for each hidden layer are as follows:\n$$\\Delta x_l = -\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_l} = -\\epsilon_l + W_{l+1}^T (\\epsilon_{l+1} \\odot f'(W_{l+1}x_l)), \\quad \\text{for } l = 1,..., L-1,$$"}, {"title": "2.1 Dynamical Systems Background", "content": "In this section, we outline the key concepts of stability and robustness taken from dynamical systems theory; these are essential for analyzing the behavior of neural networks and their corresponding learning algorithms. Understanding these concepts further allows us to characterize the performance and reliability of different models in terms of their dynamical properties. Note that the definitions stated here are not rigorous, due to a lack of space needed to properly define all the details, and notation. Readers interested in the formal definitions, used to be formally prove the theorems of this work, should refer to the supplementary material.\nFirstly, we characterize what it means for a dynamical system to be stable.\nDefinition 2.1. A dynamical system is said to be stable if, for any given \u0454 > 0, there exists a d > 0 such that if the initial state x(0) is within 8 of an equilibrium point x* (i.\u0435., |x(0) \u2212 x*| < \u03b4), then the state x(t) remains within \u0454 of x* for all t > 0 (i.e., |x(t) \u2212 x*| < \u0454 for all t > 0).\nWe further consider comparing stability between two dynamical systems, defining conditions under which one system is considered more stable than another.\nDefinition 2.2. Let D and D' be two dynamical systems with equilibrium points x and xp,, respectively. The system D is said to be more stable than D' if, for the same perturbation or initial deviation from equilibrium, D either:\n(i) Converges to its equilibrium point faster than D',\n(ii) Remains closer to its equilibrium point over time, or,\n(iii) Has a larger region of attraction, indicating greater tolerance to perturbations.\nNext, we define the key dynamical systems analysis concept of a system reaching a fixed point.\nDefinition 2.3. A point x* \u2208 R\u201d is called a fixed point or equilibrium point of the dynamical system x(t) =\nf(x(t)) if f(x*) = 0. The system is said to converge to the fixed point x* if, for initial states x(0) in a neighborhood of x*, the trajectories satisfy limt\u2192\u221e x(t) = x*.\nLastly, we address the rate of convergence between two stable dynamical systems, which can be used to measure convergence bounds for deep neural networks.\nDefinition 2.4.

Robust systems can handle variations without significant degradation, which is critical for practical applications. This notion can be defined as follows:\nDefinition 2.5. A dynamical system is said to be robust to random perturbations if, for any small random perturbation n(t) acting on the system, the perturbed state xn(t) remains close to the unperturbed state x(t) with high probability for all t > 0. This implies that the system can maintain its desired performance despite small random disturbances.\nSimilarly, robustness with respect to initial conditions ensures consistent system behavior even when starting from a range of possible initial states due to uncertainties or randomness.\nDefinition 2.6. A dynamical system is said to be robust to random initial conditions if, given initial state x(0) drawn from a probability distribution with bounded support, the system's state x(t) remains close to the desired trajectory or equilibrium point x* (t) with high probability for all t \u2265 0."}, {"title": "3 Theoretical Results", "content": "In this section, we study the convergence and stability of PCNs by leveraging the framework of dynamical systems and Lyapunov stability theory established above. We establish a series of theorems that states that, if activation functions and their higher-order derivatives are Lipschitz continuous, PCNs converge to Lyapunov stable equilibrium points. These results are then used to compare convergence speed of PCNs against backpropagation (BP) updates. Note that such a condition on the activations excludes linear rectifiers (ReLUs) yet includes oft-used ones such as the logistic sigmoid, the hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and the newly proposed TeLU [34].\nThe following theorem provides a characterization of the convergence and stability of the PCN based on the properties of these types of functions (proof in the appendix).\nTheorem 3.1. Let M be a PCN that minimizes a free energy F = L+ E, where L is the backprop loss and E is the residual energy. Assume the activation function f and its derivatives f', f\", and f'\" are Lipschitz continuous with constants K, K', K\", and K'\", respectively. Then, the convergence and stability of the PCN can be characterized by the bounds involving these higher-order derivatives.\nThe above shows that if a PCN uses activations that are smooth and well-behaved (i.e., they and their first few derivatives change gradually without sudden spikes), then the network will converge reliably and maintain stability during training.\nThe next theorem crucially connects PCNs with continuous-time dynamical systems, facilitating analysis of their behavior with the plethora of tools of dynamical systems theory. Usefully, the result below effectively establishes that the dynamics of the neuronal layers (the E-steps [35]) that make up PCNs do converge to equilibrium points\nTheorem 3.2. Let M be a PCN that minimizes a free energy function F = L + E, where L is the backprop loss and E is the residual energy. Assume that L(x) and E(x) are positive definite, and their sum F(x) has a strict minimum at x = x*, where F(x*) = 0. Further, assume the activation function f and its derivatives f', f\" are Lipschitz continuous with constants K, K', K\", respectively. Then, the PCN dynamics can be represented as a continuous-time dynamical system, and the Lyapunov function V(x) = F(x) ensures convergence to the equilibrium x = x*.\nTheorem 3.2 establishes the stability and convergence properties of a PCN that minimizes the variational free energy F = L + E. The conditions assumed are that both L(x) and E(x) are positive definite, meaning they are zero only at a unique equilibrium x = x* \u2013 where F(x*) = 0 \u2013 and are strictly positive otherwise. The theorem further states that the free energy function F(x) can be used as a Lyapunov function, V(x) = F(x), to analyze the PCN's behavior as a continuous-time dynamical system. Since V(x) is positive definite and decreases along the system's trajectories, it implies that the system will converge stably to the equilibrium point x* during training. Additionally, the smoothness assumptions on the activation f and its derivatives (up to second order, i.e., f' and f\") being Lipschitz continuous ensures that the updates are stable and do not lead to erratic behavior (proof/assumptions in the appendix). The importance of this result is that it provides a formal guarantee for the convergence of PCNs, even in complex multi-layered networks.\nThe following result formally establishes that the parameter updates (M-steps) [35], governed by Equation 4, reliably converge to a fixed point of the variational free energy function. This convergence is a consequence of the underlying dynamics of PCNs, where the state variables x are first optimized to minimize the free energy F during inference, and subsequently, the weight parameters W are updated to reflect these optimal states.\nIn a PCN, the state optimization operates on a faster timescale compared to parameter optimization. The minimization of F(x) with respect to x stabilizes the network states, ensuring that the network's predictions are aligned with observations.

With L(W) corresponding to the BP loss and E(W) representing the residual energy of the system, we are able to establish that a PCN's trajectory (through a loss surface) is Lyapunov stable.

The Newton-Raphson update rule, for example, is given as follows:\n$$W_{t+1} = W_t - H^{-1} \\nabla L(W_t)$$\nwhere H is the Hessian matrix of the loss function L. Notably, the weight updated performed by PC has been shown to approximate second-order optimization methods, specifically Gauss-Newton updates [21]. In this section, we extend this result by showing first that it is the residual energy term E that modifies the gradient similarly to what the inverse Hessian does. Second, we connect this modification to QN updates, broadening the understanding of PC within this optimization framework. Finally, we compare the computed bounds against those obtained for target propagation (TP) [37], a popular biologically plausible learning algorithm for deep neural networks, and show that PC updates are much closer to QN updates as compared to TP, while converging faster to solutions. Let us start with the following:\nTheorem 3.7. Let M be a neural network that minimizes a free energy F = L + E, where L is the loss function and E is the residual energy. Assume the activation function f and its derivatives f', f\", and f'\" are Lipschitz continuous with constants K, K', K\", and K'\", respectively. Then, the PC updates approximate quasi-Newton updates by incorporating higher-order information through the residual energy term E.\nGiven the above, let us now assume that we are faced with a learning task where we prefer using a stable training algorithm. As QN updates are well-known for their stability [36], we could favor one algorithm over another if the first better approximates such updates. Motivated by this, we next compare PC and TP, showing that the first better approximates QN updates:\nTheorem 3.8. Let M be a neural network minimizing a free energy function F = L + E, where L is the loss function and E is a residual energy term. Let HGN = JT J denote the Gauss-Newton matrix, where J is the Jacobian matrix of the network's output with respect to the parameters.

Then, the approximation error between the updates and the true Quasi-Newton update satisfies EPC < ETP, where:\nEPC = ||AWPC - AWQN||, ETP = ||AWTP - AWQN||.\nThus, PC is mathematically closer to the true Quasi-Newton updates than TP.\nThe following theorem builds on the previous result and formally proves that PC reaches fixed points faster than TP, bolstering the value of PC bio-inspired learning over approaches such as TP."}, {"title": "5 Conclusion", "content": "In this work, we conducted a rigorous study of the stability and robustness of the biological inference and learning framework known as predictive coding (PC).

Why is Stability Important?\nStability is a fundamental property of neural networks, ensuring that small changes in the input or initial conditions do not cause large, unpredictable variations in the network's output. Stability is crucial for both training and deployment. During training, instability can cause gradients to explode, leading to chaotic updates and preventing convergence. During deployment, an unstable network might produce drastically different outputs for minor input changes, undermining its reliability. In real-world scenarios where inputs are often noisy or slightly perturbed, a stable network can still produce accurate and consistent predictions, making it more reliable and robust.\nMathematical Insight:\nStability can be formally understood through the concept of *bounded sensitivity*. For a neural network f : Rn \u2192 Rm to be stable, a small change in the input dx should lead to a bounded change in the output. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n|| f(x + dx) \u2212 f(x)|| \u2264 \u039a\u00b7 ||dx||,\nfor a constant K > 0. A network is *stable* if K is small, implying that the network is not highly sensitive to input variations. A more refined way to analyze stability is through the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix Jf(x). If the largest eigenvalue Amax of Jf(x) satisfies Amax < 1, then the system is considered to be stable because small perturbations in the input will decay rather than amplify as they propagate through the network.\nIntuitive Example of Stability:\nConsider a neural network trained for handwritten digit classification. If the network is stable, adding a small amount of Gaussian noise or slightly changing the position of a digit in the image (e.g., shifting the digit by a few pixels) will not cause the network's prediction to change significantly. For example, a stable network will continue to classify a digit '8' as '8', even if the digit is slightly blurred or has a few pixels altered. This stability is essential for real-world applications where inputs are rarely perfect replicas of training data.\nDetailed Example: Training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nStability becomes even more critical in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) due to their sequential nature. Consider an RNN designed to predict the next word in a sentence. During training, if small changes in initial states or earlier inputs cause large deviations in hidden states, the RNN can produce completely different outputs, making training highly unstable. Mathematically, this corresponds to having a Jacobian matrix with eigenvalues greater than 1, which indicates that small errors will grow exponentially as they propagate through the network.\nCounterexample: Non-Stable Systems and Vanishing/Exploding Gradients\nImagine training a deep feedforward network or an RNN without appropriate regularization. If the network is not stable, even small changes in the input or initial weights can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients, making learning ineffective. For example, in a deep RNN, an input sequence with slightly perturbed values might cause the"}, {"title": "Robustness", "content": "gradients to either shrink to zero (vanishing gradient problem) or explode to very large values (exploding gradient problem), leading to poor model performance and unstable training.\nPractical Implications of Stability:\n1. Improved Training Dynamics: Stability ensures that gradient-based optimization methods produce smooth and predictable updates, enabling faster and more reliable convergence. 2. Reliable Predictions: In deployment, stable networks produce consistent outputs even with noisy or perturbed inputs, making them suitable for real-world applications like speech recognition or autonomous driving. 3. Control Over Adversarial Attacks: A stable network is less vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small, carefully crafted input changes are designed to mislead the network into producing incorrect outputs.\nReal-World Example: Stability in Financial Forecasting\nConsider a neural network used for predicting stock prices. Financial data is inherently noisy and contains sudden fluctuations. If the network is unstable, even a slight change in the input features (e.g., a minor fluctuation in daily stock prices) could lead to drastically different predictions, making the network unreliable for decision-making. On the other hand, a stable network will produce consistent and reliable forecasts, ensuring that minor changes in the data do not cause significant shifts in the predictions.\nDefinition B.8. A neural network is said to be robust to small random perturbations if, for any small random perturbation n(t) applied to its inputs or parameters, the network's output y\u014b(t) remains close to its unperturbed output y* (t) with high probability for all t > 0.\nFormally, let y(t) be the nominal (unperturbed) output of the neural network and yn(t) be the output under random perturbations n(t). The network is said to be robust if, for any \u0454 > 0, there exists a constant d > 0 and a probability threshold 1 a, such that if ||n(t)|| < d for all t \u2265 0, then:\nP(sup || yn (t) - y*(t)|| < \u03b5) \u2265 1-\u03b1.\nt\u22650\nExample 2. Why is Robustness Important?\nRobustness is a critical property for neural networks, especially in real-world applications, where input data is often noisy, contains slight perturbations, or deviates from the clean training data. A robust neural network maintains its accuracy and reliability even when faced with unexpected changes, ensuring consistent performance across diverse and challenging conditions. Robustness is crucial for safety-critical systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis), as failures can have significant real-world consequences.\nMathematical Intuition:\nRobustness can be understood mathematically through the concept of *Lipschitz continuity*. For a neural network f to be robust, small changes in the input should only cause small changes in the output. Formally, if f is K-Lipschitz, continuous, then for any two inputs x and x':\n||f(x) \u2212 f(x')|| \u2264 K \u2022 ||x \u2212 x'\\,\nwhere K is a constant that quantifies the network's sensitivity to input variations. A small K implies that the network is less sensitive to input noise, thereby enhancing robustness. Robust networks minimize K and ensure that even adversarial or noisy inputs do not cause large deviations in the output, making them more reliable.\nIntuitive Example of Robustness in Autonomous Driving:\nConsider a neural network used for object detection in an autonomous vehicle. In ideal conditions, the network correctly identifies cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs. However, in real-world scenarios, the network must operate in varying lighting conditions (e.g., night vs. day), different weather (e.g., fog, rain), and even with potential sensor noise (e.g., camera blur, reflections).\nIf the network is robust, a slight distortion in a camera image\u2014such as a shadow, slight rain droplets, or fog-will not cause it to misclassify a pedestrian as a signpost or ignore a stop sign. The network's ability to generalize well in the presence of such variations ensures safety and reliability.\nDetailed Example: Image Classification under Adversarial Noise\nLet's consider a neural network trained to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. If the network is only trained on clean images, adding small perturbations (e.g., random Gaussian noise) might lead to misclassification, even though a human observer would still recognize the digit."}, {"title": "Robustness", "content": "To test robustness", "f(x).\nCounterexample": "Non-Robust Systems in Medical Imaging\nConsider a neural network designed to detect tumors in medical images.

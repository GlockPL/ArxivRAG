Every technological advance, from the development of the abacus to the onset of the computer era, has opened up new avenues for creativity and increased the limits of human understanding. A new narrative, however, is beginning to emerge amid the many tales of technological wonders and"}, {"title": null, "content": "human ingenuity; this narrative speaks to the dawn of a truly transformative era: the era of artificial intelligence (\u0391\u0399).\nWe have all heard the myths and stories, handed down through the ages, about how the invention of the calculator revolutionized mathematics by relieving people of the mental strain of doing calculations by hand and igniting a wave of scientific inquiry. On the other hand, the development of the computer promised unparalleled computational power, allowing individuals and organizations to tackle challenging problems at a pace and efficiency never seen before.\nBut this is also the point at which the story takes an unexpected turn that fundamentally and significantly distinguishes artificial intelligence from its predecessors. You see, computers and calculators still require human operators to enter data, execute commands, and interpret results. In contrast, artificial intelligence operates at an entirely different level of autonomy. Unlike its predecessors, AI transcends rather than just augments human capabilities [1]. It performs each of these functions without the use of labor or the tangible infrastructure associated with conventional technology. It can make decisions, identify trends, and analyze big datasets.\nThe invention of computers, for instance, did not lead to widespread unemployment as initially feared. Instead, it opened up new vistas of employment opportunities, from software development to IT support. However, the advent of artificial intelligence represents a paradigm shift of a different magnitude altogether. While computers extended human capabilities, AI has the potential to replace them. It's not just about automating manual tasks anymore; it's about machines being able to learn, adapt, and even innovate independently. This level of autonomy has far-reaching implications for industries, economies, and societies at large. As AI continues to advance, it's not just blue-collar jobs that are at risk; white-collar professions like accounting, legal services, and even medicine are facing the prospect of automation.\nEssentially, the development of artificial intelligence signals the beginning of a new chapter in human history, one in which the definition of productivity and labor itself are being altered. It is about radically changing how we view and engage with technology, not just about streamlining procedures or improving current workflows. It is crucial that we foresee the consequences of this brave new world of AI-driven automation and proactively shape laws and procedures to guarantee a time when people and machines can live in harmony. In essence, artificial intelligence (AI) represents a paradigm shift-a venture into the unknown where machines are endowed with sentience and agency. It makes it possible for algorithms to navigate challenging situations, resolve challenging issues, and even develop and adapt over time [2]. The thought of this technological wonder's ability to completely change every aspect of our lives-from healthcare and transportation to finance and entertainment-is both amazing and unsettling.

AI DISRUPTION AND ITS IMPACT ON WORK HOURS", "content": "Al's unparalleled degree of autonomy has significant ramifications for the nature of work and established employment structures [4]. The first industrial revolution led to the establishment of the 40-hour workweek and the five-day workweek in order to meet the demands of manufacturing and production-based economies [5]. But businesses, especially those in the IT industry, are seeing a dramatic change in their operational capacities as a result of the introduction of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence [6].\nBusinesses can produce more and more efficiently thanks to AI, which boosts output and, frequently, generates sizable profits [7]. However, there is a price to this increased efficiency: the possible loss of human labor. The demand for human labor may decline as AI systems grow more advanced and capable of carrying out tasks that have historically been performed by humans. This could result in fewer job opportunities and a reevaluation of the traditional workweek [8].\nA few progressive companies have already started looking into different work schedules, such as cutting the typical workweek down from five days to four [9]. Companies that adopt a reduced workweek demonstrate their recognition of the evolving nature of the workforce, as well as the significance of work-life equilibrium and employee welfare in an AI-driven world. Furthermore, a reduced workweek can result in better productivity, happier workers, and less burnout-all important factors to take into account in the disruptive era of artificial intelligence [9].\nFurthermore, companies may find themselves in a better position to adjust to the disruptive powers of artificial intelligence if they reconsider standard work schedules and embrace a reduced workweek. A shortened workweek offers prospects for more jobs to be created in addition to encouraging a better work-life balance. Companies may need to hire more workers to maintain productivity levels if employees are given fewer hours to work, which would lessen the possible impact of AI-driven automation on employment [10]. In addition to ensuring that the advantages of AI technology are distributed more fairly among workers, this move towards a more inclusive and equitable labor market can promote economic resilience [11]. Employers can harness the transformative power of AI while protecting the livelihoods and well-being of their workforce by utilizing creative workforce management strategies like flexible scheduling and remote work options."}, {"title": "III.
